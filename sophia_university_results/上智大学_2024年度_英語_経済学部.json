      "Big Tech Is Bad. Big AI Will Be Worse.\n\nTech giants Microsoft and Alphabet/Google have seized a large lead in shaping our potentially AI-dominated future. This is not good news. History has shown us that when the distribution of information was left in the hands of a few, the result is political and economic oppression. Without intervention, this history will repeat itself.\n\nIn just a few months, Microsoft broke speed records in establishing ChatGPT, a form of generative artificial intelligence that it plans to invest $10 billion into, as a household name. And last month, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet/Google, unveiled a suite of AI tools — including for email, spreadsheets and drafting all manner of text. While there is some discussion about whether Meta’s recent decision to give away its AI computer code will accelerate its progress, the reality is that all competitors to Alphabet and Microsoft remain far behind.\n\nThe fact that these companies are attempting to outpace each other, in the absence of externally imposed safeguards, should give the rest of us even more cause for concern, given the potential for AI to do great harm to jobs, privacy and cybersecurity.\n\nHistory has repeatedly demonstrated that control over information is central to whom has power and what they can do with it. At the beginning of writing in ancient Mesopotamia, most scribes were the sons of elite families, primarily because education was expensive. In medieval Europe, the clergy and nobility were much more likely to be literate than ordinary people, and they used this advantage to reinforce their social standing and legitimacy.\n\nLiteracy rates rose alongside industrialization, although those who decided what the newspapers printed and what people were allowed to say on the radio, and then on television, were hugely powerful. But with the rise of scientific knowledge and the spread of telecommunications came a time of multiple sources of information and many rival ways to process facts and reason out implications.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, the internet offered even lower-cost ways to express opinions. But over time the channels of communication concentrated into a few hands including Facebook, which exacerbated political polarization and in some well-documented cases also fanned the flames of ethnic hatred. In authoritarian regimes, such as China, the same technologies have turned into tools of totalitarian control.\n\nWith the emergence of AI, we are about to regress even further. Some of this has to do with the nature of the technology. Instead of assessing multiple sources, people are increasingly relying on the nascent technology to provide a singular, supposedly definitive answer. There is no easy way to access the footnotes or links that let users explore the underlying sources.\n\nThis technology is in the hands of two companies that philosophically root in the notion of “machine intelligence,” which emphasizes the ability of computers to outperform humans in specific activities. Deep Mind, a company now owned by Google, is proud of developing algorithms that can beat human experts at games such as chess and Go.\n\nThis philosophy was naturally amplified by a recent economic idea that the singular objective of corporations should be to maximize short-term shareholder wealth. Combined together, these ideas are cementing the notion that the most productive applications of AI replace humankind. Doing away with grocery store clerks in favor of self-checkout kiosks does very little for the productivity of those who remain employed, for example, while also annoying many customers. But it makes it possible to fire workers and tilt the balance of power further in favor of management.\n\nFortunately, Marx was wrong about the 19th-century industrial age that he inhabited in. Industries emerged much faster than he expected, and new firms disrupted the economic power structure. Countervailing social powers developed in the form of trade unions and genuine political representation for a broad swath of society.",
      "On May 11 the US. Covid-19 Public Health Emergency officially expired. The unprecedented pressures of the past three years, all of us who are combining career and kids had to use new moves, and a lot of them, in order to “make it work.” Maybe you and your partner learned to alternate shifts on the days daycare was closed, or you led off each Zoom call with a disclaimer that the baby was in the background — and so on.\n\nSome of these hacks continue to serve us well. Maybe thousands of Zoom-call disclaimers later, you've gotten comfortable discussing family responsibilities with colleagues and feel more authentic on the job. Or maybe continuing to work remotely part time allows you to stay more involved in the kids’ school activities than you ever could have while commuting five days a week. And certain practical pandemic-era solutions (think: virtual parent-teacher conferences) are so working parent-friendly that we'd all do well to keep them.\n\nAt the same time, many of our Covid-era routines and beliefs aren’t helping us anymore. In fact, some of these practical and mental moves, now deeply embedded in our muscle memory, are actually making it harder for us to do what we really want: to succeed in our careers, to be loving and present caregivers, and staying healthy, whole, and ourselves in the process.\n\nIn order to set yourself up for success in combining career and children going forward, I want you to challenge that muscle memory a little. You’ve likely already done some deliberate, careful thinking about how to take the good from the pandemic era, homing in on the routines and behaviors (like those more regular family mealtimes) you absolutely want to keep. Now, try going one step further and ask yourself: What isn’t serving me anymore? To spur along that thinking, let’s get specific. Below, I'll share low-stakes but effective ways for you to reset: to tweak and update particular habits or perspectives so that they can work better for you going forward.\n\nMake prudent, ongoing decisions about the childcare you really need.\n\nWhat care arrangement do I need today in order to do my job effectively? Maybe that means having the kids stay in the school aftercare program two days a week so you can make it to in-person sales calls, or maybe now that your partner is back at work full time, you decide to extend the nanny-share arrangement to cover Fridays as well.\n\nThe point is to get away from being chained to unrealistic standards and to start proactively managing toward current needs. And no, getting adequate care doesn’t make you a bad parent. It means that when you’re with your kids, you can be with them — and not frazzled, ground down, and/or trying to do a demanding job at the same time.\n\nThink as broadly and creatively as possible about the flex arrangement that will work for you.\n\nYou worked at home for two-plus years and never missed a Zoom call, much less a deadline. Now, your company is pushing for a return to the office and it feels as if you’re being asked to relinquish the single precious tool that makes being a working parent manageable — but remote work is not the only one. If a key goal is to be available to your kids during evening homework time, perhaps shifting your hours or working a compressed schedule could do the trick instead. Or maybe other, more structural changes are what’s really called for at this point in your life and career; for example, a job-sharing arrangement could allow you two full days off per week. The more expansive your thinking, the more likely you are to be able to craft the specific working-parent life you want.\n\nDiscuss work in a positive way with your kids.\n\nWhen work and home-life responsibilities clash, as they did so often and starkly throughout the pandemic, it’s natural to view and talk about them in oppositional terms. And you're only human, after all: Your boss’s message is stressful to read, or you're disappointed about missing dinner.\n\nBut try flipping things and seeing them from your kids’ perspective. They’ve watched you quite closely these past few years. They’ve seen your tension and disappointments and witnessed your short fuse. As you nurture them toward their own eventual adulthoods, are those really the feelings and attitudes you want them to associate with work and career? There’s no need to talk about work in purely rosy terms, but think about updating your script a bit. Say, “Mom is going to work” instead of “Mom has to go to work” — or talk with the kids about a recent work success, or a moment you were proud of, or what drew you into your field or function in the first place. Let them see some of the upsides and satisfaction you find in your work so they can start imagining their own.\n\nAsk yourself what other pandemic-era habits you want to hold firmly, forever — and which to pivot away from, starting today. Trust your instincts. This is your life and career and family, and you know what works. As you iterate and refine your thinking, what will emerge is your new, unique playbook — not for surviving as a working parent in a crisis, but for thriving now, and in the future.",

      "Naomi: Where is Ash? This meeting was supposed to start fifteen minutes ago.\n\nTrent: Patience, Naomi. Ash may not always be punctual, but he will be here. This decision affects the whole team.\n\nAsh: I’m so sorry, folks! My lunch meeting with our brand managers just wouldn’t end! Naomi: Finally! And no, we’ve been waiting for ages. The CEO is eager to hear our candidate to manage the digital marketing team.\n\nTrent: Agreed. We have two strong candidates, and they both bring unique strengths to the table.\n\nNaomi: First up, we have Jason. He’s been with the company for years and has a proven track record. He’s organized, efficient, and great with managing teams.\n\nAsh: Trent: Then we have Sarah. She's relatively new, but her creativity and fresh perspective have brought incredible results. She's innovative and has an uncanny ability to sense trends.\n\nAsh: I hear her work really shines. So, who to choose? We can’t have one without the other.\n\nNaomi: Jason’s experience gives him an edge. We need stability and someone who knows the industry inside out.\n\nTrent: But Sarah’s creativity pushes boundaries and her judgement on emerging trends keeps us relevant and our followers on social media engaged. Fashion is about innovation, after all.\n\nAsh: I see both your points.\n\nTrent: How? Ash: What if we promote both Jason and Sarah to co-manage the team? Jason can handle the organizational aspects, and Sarah can infuse her creative vision.\n\nNaomi: Co-managers? The team would get the experience and the fresh perspective they need.\n\nTrent: But won't two co-managers lead to friction and confusion? Naomi: How about we appoint Jason as manager of digital media, and Sarah as influencer marketing manager? They are separate responsibilities and, if there is any conflict, they both report to Ash anyway, right? Ash: It might be more work for me, but I like that idea. It allows us to harness the strengths of both candidates and create a collaborative environment.\n\nTrent: Excellent! Let's make it official then and get this proposal to the CEO, immediately. Ash, it's time to work your magic and conjure up an unbeatable argument to secure budget for two new managers!",

      "Your Most Ambivalent Relationships Are the Most Toxic It’s been two decades, but I still feel nervous when I think of an old boss of mine. One day she nominated me for an award for service to the organization. Then she threatened to fire me for raising a concern about a colleague being mistreated. “If you ever speak up out of turn again,” she said, “I’ll have you fired.” I walked on eggshells until the day she quit.\n\nWe often think about relationships on a spectrum from positive to negative. We gravitate toward loving family members, caring classmates, and supportive mentors. We do our best to avoid the cruel uncle, the playground bully, and the jerk boss.\n\nBut the most toxic relationships aren’t the purely negative ones. They’re the ones that are a mix of positive and negative.\n\nWe often call them frenemies, supposed friends who sometimes help you and sometimes hurt you. But it’s not just friends. It’s the in-laws who volunteer to watch your kids but belittle your parenting. The roommate who gets you through a breakup and then starts dating your ex. The manager who praises your work but denies you a promotion.\n\nEveryone knows how relationships like that can tie your stomach into a knot. But groundbreaking research fronted by the psychologists Bert Uchino and Julianne Holt-Lunstad shows that ambivalent relationships can be damaging to your health — even more than purely negative relationships. One study found that adults had higher blood pressure after interacting with people who evoked mixed feelings than after similar interactions with those who evoked negative feelings.\n\nYou can see it at work, too. An independent team of researchers found that Slovenian police officers whose supervisor both supported and demeaned them reported more negative physical symptoms and were more likely to miss work than officers who said their supervisor only undermined them. And among older adults, the more ambivalent relationships they had in their lives, the more depressed they felt, the more their heart rates spiked under stress, and the more their blood pressure climbed in response to stress over the next 10 months.\n\nI had assumed that with a neighbor or a colleague, having some positive interactions was better than all negative interactions. But being cheered on by the same person who cuts you down doesn’t ease the bad feelings; it amplifies them. And it’s not just in your head: It leaves a trace in your heart and your blood.\n\nEven a single ambivalent interaction can take a toll, and its causation, not correlation. In one experiment, people gave impromptu speeches on controversial topics in front of a friend who offered feedback. Unbeknown to the participants, the researchers had randomly assigned the friend to give ambivalent or negative comments. Receiving mixed feedback caused higher blood pressure than pure criticism. “I would have gone about the topic differently, but you’re doing fine” proved to be more distressing than “I totally disagree with everything you’ve said.”\n\nThe evidence that ambivalent relationships can be bad for us is strong, but the reasons can be harder to read — just like the relationships themselves.\n\nThe most intuitive reason is that ambivalent relationships are unpredictable. With a clear enemy, you put up a shield when you cross paths. With a frenemy, you never know whether Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde is going to show up. Ambivalence short-circuits the parasympathetic nervous system and activates a fight-or-flight response. It’s unnerving to hope for a hug while bracing yourself for a brawl.\n\nAnother factor is that unpleasant interactions are more painful in an ambivalent relationship. It’s more upsetting to be let down by people you like sometimes than by people you dislike all the time. When someone stabs you in the back, it stings more if he’s been friendly to your face.\n\nFinally, ambivalence is an invitation for rumination. We agonize about ambiguous comments, unsure what to make of them and whether to trust the people who make them. We dwell on our mixed feelings, torn between avoiding our frenemies and holding out hope that they’ll change.\n\nFrenemies are the people who hurt us the most; we’re much slower to drop them than enemies. In our lives, we have about as many ambivalent relationships as supportive connections. And we don’t seem to get better with age at handling them. Of course, although no relationship is purely positive, any relationship that crosses the line into being abusive should be jettisoned.\n\nEarly in my career, I invested a great deal of energy in mentoring a student. When I asked for feedback, I learned that the relationship had looked different from where she stood. On the one hand, she appreciated my rapid responses and clear guidance. On the other hand, my answers were too directive: I was silencing her voice and crowding out her ideas. What I thought was being supportive was actually undermining her autonomy. As Anne Lamott puts it, “Help is the sunny side of control.” It’s all too rare for us to exchange this kind of feedback. Sometimes we end up avoiding or ghosting the people who stress us out in this way. It isn’t always a deliberate decision; we procrastinate on replies and put off lunches until the relationship fades away. Other times, we just grit our teeth and tolerate.",
      "ambivalent relationships as they are.\n\nA relationship in which you can't be candid isn’t a relationship at all; it’s a charade. Research shows that we tend to underestimate how open people are to constructive suggestions. Feedback doesn't always lead to change, but change doesn’t happen without feedback. ‘The goal is to be as candid as possible in what you say and as caring as possible in how you say it. As Brené Brown emphasizes, “Clear is kind.” I’ve seen people try to address ambivalence by declaring, “This relationship isn’t healthy for me.” That isn’t accurate; it's often received as “You're a bad person” when the reality is inevitably more complicated. An ambivalent relationship deserves a more nuanced, more accurate message: “The mix of good and bad here isn’t healthy for us.” Not every ambivalent relationship can or should be salvaged. A few years ago, my old boss reached out to say she’d enjoyed one of my articles. It felt too late to tell her how stressful I had found it to be in constant limbo, not knowing whether she was going to lift me up or kick me down. I wonder if she’ll end up reading about it here and if she remembers our interactions with mixed feelings, too.",
      "Musician and fellow refugee Yevheniia Diachenko set up the group in January to bring Ukrainian children together. Cherwell College Oxford hosts the one-hour weekly choir for those who fled their home country during the Russian invasion. Mrs. Diachenko said it had helped the children to “forget about the bad things and relax.” “When they sing, they show their emotions, and sometimes they even cry, but in a good way,” said the 41-year-old, who now lives in Oxford. “They miss their families, they miss their dads who stay in Ukraine, but they feel support from each other and music helps to heal their hearts.” Mrs. Diachenko had her own vocal school in Kyiv, and said she wanted to continue teaching singing lessons when she arrived in Oxford in July last year with her nine-year-old daughter Katrin. “We wanted the children to feel more at home, to speak with each other and play together,” she said. Her daughter Katrin said the singing classes had helped her adjust to life in the UK after initially feeling “really sad.” She said: “I think art helped me when I came here and I thought that since my mummy is a singing teacher, I can do some singing too to help her. The choir is really nice, I have really good friends here and I like singing.” Katrin’s friend, 10-year-old Alisa Klauning, said the choir has helped her feel she is “not alone.” “I feel quite safe in this group, and I feel that I can talk with anybody about what’s happened in Ukraine,” she said."
