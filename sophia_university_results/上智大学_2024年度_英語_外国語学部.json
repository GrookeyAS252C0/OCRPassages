      "The Secrets of Successful Female Networkers One often-cited reason why more female executives don’t advance to top management jobs is their lack of access to informal organizational and industry networks. Some people blame unconscious bias: High-ranking men connect more easily with other men. Others cite professional and personal obligations, from office housekeeping to child-rearing, that fall to women, leaving them less time to develop professional relationships.\n\nBut some female leaders do establish strong networks — and they win greater influence and more senior positions as a result. What are they doing differently? A new study sheds light on their strategies. “I was talking with many women about how to improve their networks, the challenges they face, and what they and their organizations could do better, and I realized that all the studies on the issue were pretty old and narrow,” explains Inga Carboni, a professor at William & Mary's Mason School of Business and the study's lead author. “I couldn't answer their questions.”\n\nThe researchers analyzed data collected from 16,500 men and women in more than 30 organizations across a range of industries over the past 15 years. Then they interviewed hundreds of female executives. This led them to identify characteristics that distinguish the networking behaviors of more successful women from those of their peers. In some cases those matched the behaviors of high-ranking men: in others there were subtle but important differences.\n\nWhen shaping their professional networks, top women were: Studies, including the new one, show that women generally absorb more collaborative demands in the workplace than their male peers do. But the female managers with the strongest networks “recognize that every ‘yes’ means a ‘no’ to something else,” says Babson College’s Rob Cross, one of Carboni's coauthors. He notes that one Silicon Valley executive he knows has adopted that idea as her mantra. Although these successful female networkers might feel an identity-driven desire and a stereotype-influenced pressure to help colleagues out and be a team player, they try to resist. They prune nonessential appointments from their calendars, deflect low-priority decisions and requests, run efficient meetings, insist on efficient email norms, and set aside time for reflection and high-level thinking. At the same time, they make the most of their collaborative strengths and inclinations by working with others in a way that establishes or enhances key relationships and ups their visibility.\n\nOrganizations can do their part by tracking unseen collaborative work, ensuring that it’s evenly spread among male and female employees, and pushing all leaders, but especially women, to prioritize their most important tasks.\n\nSuccessful female networks are fluid. High-ranking women know when to deemphasize old connections in favor of new ones (whether by proactively cutting ties or by simply failing to maintain contact). For example, says Cross, “when you’re at an inflection point at work or are embarking on a new project, you want to think about your goals and who will help you reach them — whether those goals are political (gaining early access to opinion leaders), developmental (supplementing skills gaps), innovation-oriented (searching for new insights), or related to best practices (finding people who know efficiencies).” The researchers say they hope more women will adapt their networking behaviors in keeping with these characteristics. They add that organizations have a big role to play too. “The goal is to normalize these behaviors and practices so that they're the norm for everybody,” Cross says.",
      "On the roof of an abandoned building in a Dutch city, Frankie and Dora sip Taiwanese bubble tea in the summer sun. The two girls are dressed in vintage jeans and self-decorated sneakers. Frankie's T-shirt celebrates an art exhibition, Dora's Billie Eilish, a singer whom she likes because “she speaks her mind.”\n\nThe girls discovered this spot through TikTok. They learned about the tooth-achingly sweet bubble tea from Instagram. The naughtiest thing they have done recently is sneak out to go to a political protest. They do not think there is anything they cannot do because they are girls. “I think that’s from another time,” says Dora.\n\nFrankie, Dora and tens of millions of 11- to 16-year-old girls in the rich world are having a girlhood like none before. Their mothers have been far closer to equality with their fathers than in previous generations; they have a bewildering world of social media to navigate; and they are exposed to a world in which ideas about girlhood are changing fast.\n\nOne of the key changes is that being a girl is now seen as a thing in itself. For centuries, girlhood was defined in opposition to boyhood: being nice when boys were nasty, quiet when boys were loud, pretty when boys had personalities. Nowadays, girls are allowed, and allow themselves, a range of interests and behaviors that is broad and flexible.\n\nThe intense, close friendships between girls have provided subject matter for female novelists from Jane Austen to Elena Ferrante. Studies in various countries have confirmed that female friendships are more intimate and supportive. Boys in close friendships often drift apart in their teens. At the same age girls tend to come closer together than ever.\n\nAlmost all the girls we spoke with said that not seeing their friends was the hardest part of COVID lockdown, eclipsing factors like family tensions and online schooling. A survey by Britain’s Children’s Society confirms this was the case across British 10- to 17-year-olds, and that girls struggled more than boys.\n\nFamilies also invest more resources in girls than in the past. In the 1970s American parents spent significantly more on boys than girls. By 2017 the difference had disappeared. Girls today enjoy more parental spending than boys on tutoring, art supplies and music lessons.\n\nIronically, some old gender stereotypes related to children’s upbringing may now help girls. When girls are toddlers they are read to more than boys. Their fathers are five times more likely to sing to them and are more likely to speak to them about emotions, including sadness. Their mothers are more likely to use complex vocabulary with them. Most of this gives girls an advantage in a world that increasingly prizes “soft skills.” Girls still have less leisure time than boys, but nowadays that is primarily because they spend more time on homework and grooming, rather than because house chores are unfairly divided.\n\nDaughters can change parents’ values too, particularly fathers’. Researchers have found that having daughters decreases fathers’ likelihood of holding traditional attitudes on gender roles and makes them more likely to pull their weight in housework. Separate studies have shown that having daughters affects decisions by politicians and judges. Businessmen with daughters are more likely to support women's professional careers.\n\nOne thing most girls agree on is that their parents take too one-sided an approach to technology. “My parents think it’s all a bunch of drama and distraction and that we’re all addicted,” complains Frankie, “but it can be really inspiring, too. There are lots of women standing up for things online.” Girls are increasingly told — and increasingly feel — that they wield power. And even if they do not believe that they run the world, they certainly want to improve it. Carol Gilligan, a psychologist, points out that young girls have long been imagined as brave and outspoken on controversial issues, from Charlotte Brontë’s heroine Jane Eyre, to Claudia in Toni Morrison's novel The Bluest Eye. As real-life girls hit their teens, though, they tended to stop speaking up, pressured as they were to become “likeable” young women.\n\nToday’s girls learn that now they have the tools needed to speak louder — from education, to the internet, to freedom to leave the house — their voices will be heard. Girls now are more likely than boys to say that they want to make the world a better place, or that they want to be a leader.\n\nHigh expectations are undoubtedly a risk. When you ask girls what makes them anxious, many mention pressure: pressure to do good, look good and be good.\n\nWhen she is asked “Do you think you can change the world?”, Frankie looks panicked. “By myself? Oh God no. What if I can’t fix the problems?” Then she realizes the “you” is plural, which changes everything. “Oh, you mean all girls,” she says with a sigh of relief. “Of course we can.”",
      "The belief that some things should not be done by girls. The belief that social media is good for you. The belief that teenagers should have to do what their parents say.\n\nWhat does it mean that “being a girl is now seen as a thing in itself”? Being a girl is now seen as something to be envied. Girls are no longer seen as just the opposite of boys. Girls have become less visible and successful in society. Girls nowadays spend less time playing with boys.\n\nWhy did girls struggle more than boys during COVID lockdown, according to the article? Because parents enforced lockdown more strictly on girls than boys. Because girls fought more with their families than boys. Because girls suffered more from not being able to meet their friends. Because girls spent more time on social media than boys.\n\nWhich statement about modern parenting is NOT mentioned in the article? Fathers are more likely to talk to daughters about emotions. Girls still spend more time doing housework than boys. Mothers are more likely to use complicated words with girls. Parents spend more money on tutoring girls than boys.\n\nBased on the article, a man who has a daughter would be more likely to show which of the following behaviors? A tendency to leave the housework to women. A greater interest in women’s sports. A tendency to reject feminist political attitudes. A willingness to promote women at his workplace.\n\nWhich of these is closest to the meaning, in this context, of “too one-sided\"? Too close to the truth. Too focused on the negative. Too relaxed about the dangers. Too sexist.\n\nLiterary works by Charlotte Bronté and Toni Morrison are introduced to support what argument? The argument that, despite gender inequality in the past, there were many female authors. The argument that female characters in fiction have often been represented as courageous. The argument that female leadership has rarely been seen in fiction, but often in real life. The argument that girls become more outspoken as they enter their teens.\n\nAccording to the article, what was the main reason that teenage girls tended to stop speaking up on controversial issues in the past? Because they felt pressure to be likeable. Because they focused on close friendships instead. Because they lacked famous role models. Because they were under pressure to be leaders.\n\nHow does Frankie at first misunderstand the question “Do you think you can change the world?” She thinks that the questioner is asking about all the problems in the world, not just gender problems. She thinks that the questioner is asking if she can change the world while she is still a child. She thinks that the questioner means her individually, rather than girls in general. She thinks that the questioner is asking if she can change her local community, rather than the whole world.\n\nWhich of these statements is closest to the main point of this article? A crisis of masculinity is negatively affecting young boys’ sense of self-esteem. Although men were previously in control in society, the situation is now mostly reversed. Gender inequality is still a major problem and will take many years to solve. The experience of being a girl is more flexible and contains more possibilities than before.",
      "Soon after we moved to the town of Belle Meade in Nashville in 1987, I started hearing stories about a brilliant man who didn’t exactly behave according to norms. Neil Cargile was the president of a Nashville-based dredging company with business the world over. Born into wealth in 1928, he played football at Vanderbilt University, flew planes for the Navy, married and divorced twice, and fathered three children. He was a small-government conservative. He was also famous in Nashville for his pleasure in wearing women’s clothes on social occasions. Mr. Cargile called his alter ego “SheNeil.” Just before he died, Mr. Cargile was the subject of a 1995 New Yorker article by John Berendt titled “High Heel Neil.” Mr. Berendt called his subject “probably the most socially prominent cross-dresser in America since Edward Hyde served, in drag, as the governor of New York and New Jersey in the early 18th century.” Like those Easterners of old, Nashville residents were unsurprised by their high-profile drag queen. Mr. Cargile consistently gave only one explanation for wearing such extravagant clothes: “It’s fun.” That same spirit of play is presumably what motivated Bill Lee, the Republican governor of Tennessee, to dress like a cheerleader for a football game when he was a student in high school. Mr. Lee doesn't have fun with such things anymore: He just signed a law that makes it illegal to appear in drag in public spaces where children might be present.\n\nUntil Holly McCall, the editor of the nonprofit news site The Tennessee Lookout, mentioned Mr. Cargile in an editorial attacking the state’s new anti-drag law, I hadn’t thought about him in years, perhaps because the distance between his world and mine — in time, in politics, in basic human decency — is so vast and so extreme.\n\nThe idea that Lee’s legislation is a top priority for anybody in Tennessee is crazy, and once upon a recent time, even Republicans knew that. Men have performed in women’s clothes for centuries, with no harm to children. Drag is part festival and part artistic expression, and many types of people enjoy it. Dolly Parton, Tennessee’s most famous singer, often says, “If I hadn't been a girl, I'd have been a drag queen.” It’s worth noting that a lot of men out there are wearing a lot of garments that look a lot like dresses. Priests and judges, for instance. Actors in “Mrs. Doubtfire” and “Hairspray,” both of which are on the new schedule at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. Are they all now obliged to wear trousers? I’m joking, of course. This is a law that bans “adult cabaret.” It doesn’t bar men from wearing ritual gowns. But here’s the real question, and it’s not a joke: If it’s fine for men to wear gowns in other contexts, what’s the problem with drag queens in a Pride parade or a library’s story hour? Why wouldn’t it be fine for a drag queen to mingle on Main Street with all the bridesmaids?",
      "When Pauline Kauinani Souza was a child in Hawaii, she spent early mornings watering her grandfather’s watermelons and papaya trees. Her family lived frugally, eating homemade bread and heating water over a fire for bathing. But their no-frills life came with the ultimate benefit: living near the beach and drifting off to sleep at night to the sound of waves gently crashing on the shore.\n\nNow, at 80, Ms. Souza lives in Las Vegas, a desert city of neon far from the ocean and her ancestral home. It is not paradise, but it is full of Native Hawaiians like her who have flocked there in recent years for the endless entertainment, reasonable cost of living, and something few people find in Hawaii: a house they can afford. “I own it outright,” she said proudly of her two-bedroom, ranch-style home in Las Vegas. “In Hawaii, there aren’t many people who can say that.” Increasingly, Las Vegas is drawing Hawaiians who will come to visit and decide to stay, convinced that an affordable false version of the islands is better than an endless struggle to make ends meet in the real thing. Between 2011 and 2021, the population of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders in Las Vegas grew by about 40 percent, for a total of nearly 22,000 people. That was the greatest number of newcomers in that group in any area outside Hawaii.\n\nFor many, the appeal is real estate: Houses in the Las Vegas area have a median listing price of about $460,000, compared with about $800,000 in Honolulu. Americans migrating for cheaper housing is not unusual. But this migration from the impossibly lush natural landscape of the islands to the brash desert of Las Vegas is a particularly vivid example of how the search for housing remakes the country in sometimes surprising ways.\n\nThe connection between Hawaii and Las Vegas stretches back decades, in large part due to the California Hotel & Casino in downtown Las Vegas. “The Cal,” which opened in 1975, has long catered to Hawaiians through special travel deals and targeted marketing. At the casino, dealers at the poker table wear Hawaiian shirts, guests dine on island specialties, and signs within the hotel’s grounds state: “Aloha Spoken Here.” Today, a flourishing Hawaiian community is scattered throughout what is informally known as the Ninth Island. Parents in Las Vegas eager to raise their children with Hawaiian traditions can enroll them in Hawaiian language classes or get them dance lessons at a local hula school. In Las Vegas, Hawaiians in search of home cooking can take their pick of local restaurants serving plate lunch and fresh fish. Even Spam musubi, a popular Hawaiian snack of rice and Spam wrapped in seaweed, and poi, a taro-based Hawaiian staple, are easy to find. “What we’re doing is creating our own Hawaii,” said Cece Cullen, 38, a Native Hawaiian, at a lei festival this month just outside Las Vegas. Ms. Cullen attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in the early 2000s and later returned to Hawaii. But life with a growing family was difficult. She and her husband, Nakoa Hoikaika Cullen, 37, worked multiple jobs and rented a modest 800-square-foot house. But their paychecks quickly disappeared. “You get to the point where you're like, is this it? Is this life?” she said.\n\nIn 2018, Ms. Cullen and her family moved back to Las Vegas. A few months into the pandemic, she and her husband bought a roughly 3,000-square-foot house on a quiet street. They are among the first in their family to be homeowners. And in Las Vegas, they live comfortably, raising four children. Ms. Cullen, who teaches the Hawaiian language at local libraries, has made it a priority to keep her children connected to the islands’ culture. “We got driven out of paradise,” she said. “But all these traditions, all our language, it’s part of our identity.”\n\nIn 2022, Hawaii had the highest cost of living out of all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The state imports the vast majority of its food, which has made everyday groceries especially expensive. And strict regulations on building have contributed to housing shortages and prices out of reach for many. Representative Nadine K. Nakamura said that the state government recognizes the economic pressures on local residents and has been focused on expanding tax relief and building more affordable housing.\n\nFar from the islands, Native Hawaiians have found creative ways to keep their culture alive in the desert. After moving from Oahu to Las Vegas in 2014, Tiffanie Zuttermeister, 46, accepted that she would never be able to grow her own ti leaves, which are used for leis and hula skirts. Still, Ms. Zuttermeister has managed to create a successful side business making leis for graduations and other events. Unlike other local lei makers, who resort to using plastic flowers, she seeks out fresh ones and orders ti leaves and orchids from Los Angeles or Hawaii. “Being away from home, I miss the ocean, the mountains, the greenery,” she said one afternoon, making a lei crown with daisies, carnations, and baby’s breath. “But I don’t miss the cost.”"
