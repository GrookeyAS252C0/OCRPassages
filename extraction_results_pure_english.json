        "The Russian Tsar Peter the Great (1672-1725) presided over an actual fashion police. His inspectors stalked the streets of St. Petersburg, shaving beards and snipping inches off coats.\n\nIf you were a bearded man in St. Petersburg around the year 1714, a token like the one pictured here would be your only defense against the overweening power of the state. It served as proof that the bearer had paid his yearly beard tax — a few kopecks for peasants, a hundred rubles or more for nobles or military officials.\n\nThe beard tax was just one part of a larger project: Peter the Great’s aesthetic reinvention of Russian culture. The Tsar ordered his subjects to replace their familiar long Russian overcoats with French or Hungarian jackets. Mannequins set outside the Moscow city gates illustrated the new fashions for all to see. Tailors who continued to sell Russian styles ran the risk of steep fines, and anyone walking the streets in an old-fashioned robe was liable to have it cut short by the Tsar's inspectors.\n\nThe project had its roots in Tsar Peter’s days travelling around Europe. In 1697, when he set out on a grand tour, Peter chose to travel in disguise, adopting the name “Sergeant Pyotr Mikhaylov.” Excited rumors of his visit spread from town to town, heralding him as a giant: seven feet tall, brilliant, and only half-civilized. The trip would consume the next two years. For a time, he worked at a Dutch shipyard to learn ship-building techniques. He visited heads of state, collections of natural curiosities, and anatomical theaters, and threw legendarily wild parties. One particularly raucous event left every one of his host’s chairs smashed into pieces, his paintings shredded into ribbons, and chunks of pavement torn out of the ground.\n\nUpon returning from his travels, Peter launched immediately into the process of “Europeanizing” his homeland. The first of the Tsar’s new enthusiasm were the beards of his court nobles, shaved at his welcome-home party. As biographer Robert K. Massie writes, “After passing among his [friends and embracing them...he began shaving off their beards” with his own hands. He doubled down at his New Year’s banquet, at which his razor-wielding court jester worked the crowd, slapping the side of the head of anyone who seemed reluctant to shave.\n\nAccording to Captain John Perry, an English visitor to Russia, the Russians submitted only upon “the terror of having [their beards] ...pulled out by the roots, or sometimes taken so rough off, that some of the skin went with them.” He goes on to tell the story of a Russian carpenter who was obliged by the Tsar’s decree to lose his beard: I jested a little with him on this occasion, telling him that he had become a young man, and asked him what he had done with his beard. Upon which he put his hand in his bosom and pulled it out, and showed it to me; also telling me, that upon returning home, he would carefully keep it to have it put in his coffin and buried along with him, that he might be able to give an account of it to Saint Nicholas in the afterlife: and that all his fellow workmen who had been shaved that day had taken the same care.\n\nIn this, the carpenter was guided by the teachings of the Russian Orthodox Church, which considered uncut facial hair a reflection of piety. Man was created in the image of God; that included the beard. To shave it was a grave sin.\n\nTo the pious, the beard tax was a shocking scandal. Rumors circulated that Peter was not the real Tsar but a replacement installed by Russia’s enemies. Anonymous letters accusing the Tsar of blasphemy (disrespect towards God) were scattered on the city streets. Nevertheless, the shavings continued. Finally, in 1705, a Russian military division initiated an open revolt in the town of Astrakhan. A letter from the rebels proclaimed that they were for Christianity and against shaving and foreign dress. The revolt was crushed, and hundreds of rebels lost their lives.\n\nThe beard tax was just one way that the Tsar sparred with the Church. With typical flair, Peter organized his drinking companions into a club known as the “All-Jesling and All-Drunken Religious Assembly of Fools and Jesters.” The members played at being cardinals and bishops and performed mock marriages and religious ceremonies. They engaged in constant merriment, compulsory drunkenness, and endless feasts and masquerades. There was no escape from the All-Drunken Assembly; appointments were for life. In this way, blasphemy served as a test of loyalty for the Tsar's closest companions. The implicit choice was clear.\n\nAs the historian V. M. Zhivov writes in “Cultural Reforms in Peter the Great's System of Transformations,” by challenging the Church's power, the Tsar sought to frame himself as a semi-divine figure, outside of the bounds of normal society:\n\nThe Tsar demonstrated that he commanded divine power, and society had the choice of either accepting this inhuman superiority or rejecting it as a satanic enterprise. In any case this posed a challenge for society. The Tsar rose above reality and, wielding the power of life and death, transformed that reality according to his desire, turning age-old customs into blasphemous entertainments.",
        "playful inventions into state institutions. Like the beard tax itself, the conflict seems absurd: a few drunken nobles playing pretend priests. But the struggle — one over the very nature of royal power — was deadly serious.\n\nWe stood up for the Christian faith and against shaving and German dress and tobacco and because we and our wives and children were not admitted into God’s church in old Russian dress. And those who went to church, of both male and female sexes, had their garments chopped up and were pushed out of God’s churches and sent packing. “Show and tell” was a method that Peter frequently employed to ensure that the public would not excuse themselves by pleading ignorance of his policies.",
        "In 1708 an informer reported that, when the Tsar was in Moscow, everyone wore German dress but in his absence the wives of some of the Tsar’s leading officials wore old-fashioned gowns to church, even though they put skirts over them, cursing the sovereign’s decree. One can infer that the skirts worn by the wives were meant as protest.\n\nHere “liable” means held legally responsible.\n\nHere “doubled down” means committed even further.\n\nHere “piety” means devotion.\n\nHere “compulsory” means mandatory.",
        "In contrast to their generally similar levels of performance on standardized tests, American boys and girls perform very differently when measured by grades in their courses in school. Because performance in courses is less standardized, there is less consensus on gender differences in this measure of academic performance. Nonetheless, evidence indicates that girls have outperformed boys academically since the turn of the twentieth century. In the middle of the nineteenth century, girls enrolled in coeducational schools at roughly the same rate as boys, and for the most part, girls in those schools took the same classes with the same teachers as their male counterparts. Even then, girls earned higher grades than boys and were promoted to the next year level more readily. Writing in 1910, J. E. Armstrong reported that “the first three primary year levels of the schools of the whole United States show that a larger number of boys than girls have to repeat their year levels; the census shows that the sexes are born in very nearly equal numbers and yet the boys are four percent more numerous in the first grade.” It is also striking that as early as 1870, when rates of high school completion were extremely low (only two percent of seventeen-year-olds completed high school at the time), more girls than boys completed high school.\n\nRegardless of their better performance in elementary school and higher rates of high school completion, young women were barred from attending college for much of the nineteenth century. They were first allowed to enroll in college in 1837, when Oberlin College began admitting women, arguably to provide ministers of religion with intelligent, cultivated, and thoroughly schooled wives. When the Civil War led to a shortage of male students, more colleges became willing to enroll tuition-paying female students. By 1900, more than twice as many women were enrolled in coeducational institutions as were enrolled in women’s colleges. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the rapid rise in the number of women enrolling in coeducational institutions precipitated a new fear that women would take over colleges.\n\nFast-forward to the current era, and the female advantage in academic performance at all levels of education is indisputable. As early as kindergarten, girls demonstrate more advanced reading skills than boys, and boys continue to have problems with reading in elementary school. From kindergarten through high school and into college, girls get better grades than boys in all major subjects, including math and science. This leads us to ask if school-based policies can help improve the educational performance of boys. Boys face particular challenges stemming from the dual nature of masculine identity during adolescence. In schools with cultures that treat academic success as compatible with a respectable status within the adolescent culture, boys are more likely to perform on a par with girls. In other words, we expect the male shortfall to be relatively small in high-quality schools.\n\nThree promising arenas of school policy intervention have the potential to improve student outcomes: teachers, student culture, and instructional and evaluation techniques. Firstly, a growing literature suggests that teacher quality affects academic performance, and some recent reports suggest that good teachers have long-lasting effects on their students. Scholars also increasingly recognize that, along with cognitive skills, social and behavioral skills affect academic achievement and later success in the labor market, and that teachers differ in their ability to promote these skills. Beyond teachers, other support staff such as guidance counselors may play an important role in students’ educational outcomes. The second promising arena of policy change, student culture and peer effects, has been a focus since the early 1960s. Finally, instructional effects are the most difficult of the three school policy interventions to study, partly because instructional curricula are not readily quantifiable. Considerable research suggests that small class sizes are better than large ones, that putting students into college preparation tracks is generally detrimental to poorly performing students, and that tough academic standards do not boost academic achievement for poorly performing students. These policy areas clearly overlap with each other; for example, teachers can contribute to student climate, better instructional techniques may improve teacher quality, and academically oriented student cultures may improve both the effectiveness of some teachers and the impact of some instructional techniques.\n\nAttachment to school is an equally powerful motivator for educational performance. Despite common perceptions, students do not generally disparage academic achievement, so long as it is accompanied by other desirable behaviors like being popular, dressing stylishly, being athletic, and otherwise participating in extracurricular activities. John Bishop and his colleagues report that 81 percent of middle and high school students who were surveyed disagreed with the statement that “it’s not cool to frequently volunteer answers or comments in class,” 85 percent disagreed with the statement that “it’s not cool to study real hard for tests and quizzes,” and 73 percent disagreed with the statement that “it’s not cool to be enthusiastic about what you are learning in school.” Apparently students begin to cross the “not cool” line when they exhibit overt competitiveness about grades, but students generally appreciate that high levels of educational achievement are valuable in today’s world.\n\nAt the same time, it is also clear from the data that girls express stronger allegiance to educational values than boys. Eighth-grade students were asked how important grades were to them and how.",
        "important they perceived grades to be to their parents. Almost 99 percent of the students reported that good grades are “very important” to their parents, with essentially no variations in these proportions by gender, parental education, or parents’ educational expectations for their child. Girls expressed a valuation that was closer to what they attributed to their parents than was the case for boys, showing that boys place greater distance between their values and the values they attribute to their parents than do girls.\n\nNow that a female advantage in educational achievement has emerged, it is natural to ask whether and how schools affect gender inequality. We need to consider whether school policies that help one gender also help the other, or whether the interests of boys and girls are incompatible, such that policies designed to help boys compete with those designed to help girls.",
        "E training high quality teachers who can promote social and behavioral skills. According to the study by John Bishop and his colleagues on middle and high school students, about half think that being overtly competitive is acceptable. Around three-quarters think it is okay to enjoy what they are studying. Most see the value of educational achievement. Over four-fifths think it is not cool to volunteer answers in class. The vast majority believe it is acceptable to study hard for tests.\n\nThe police officer warned the mayor, “You do not want to give us reason to arrest you. You will be charged with interfering with an officer of the law if you continue to obstruct this investigation. Your son has been caught selling information of a sensitive nature that he stole from his workplace then trying to run away. We are not at liberty to share any details beyond this, as it could compromise the case. Now, please stand aside.” Baby seals need solid ice to survive, but a warming world and shortage of stable ice in recent years have led to a raise in their deaths. Because of their different chemistry, some types of plastic are very easy to recycle, whereas until something changes, landfill is the only destination for others. The scientists found that human volunteers could correctly guess the meaning of each gesture made by apes over 50% of the time. When a large star dies, it explodes into a brilliant burst of light that temporarily illuminates the night skies.",
        "The lawsuit began like so many others: a man named Roberto Mata sued the airline Avianca, saying he was injured when a metal serving cart struck his knee during a flight to New York City.\n\nAvianca asked a Manhattan federal judge to dismiss the case, Mr. Mata’s lawyers strongly objected, submitting a ten-page brief that cited multiple relevant court decisions. There was Martinez v. Delta Air Lines, Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines, and Varghese v. China Southern Airlines, its detailed discussion of complex federal law.\n\nThere was one hitch: no one — not the airline’s lawyers, not even the judge himself — could find the decisions or the quotations cited and summarized in the brief.\n\nThat was because ChatGPT had invented everything.\n\nThe lawyer who created the brief, Steven A. Schwartz, threw himself at the court, confessing that he had used the AI program to do his legal research — “a source that has revealed itself to be unreliable.”"

        "The world is rich. Certainly, some parts of the world are richer than others, and many millions still live in poverty. But the world is richer than it has ever been, and it continues to grow richer with each passing day.\n\nDon't believe us? Let’s compare income around the world today to some of the wealthiest countries in the past. The average income in much of the world is now greater than the average income in the world’s richest country just over a century ago. The startling level of modern wealth comes into even clearer focus when compared to the wealthiest country in 1800: Great Britain. Almost every nation in the world, with some exceptions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, has a greater average income than the world’s leading economy just two centuries ago.\n\nModern wealth of course extends well beyond average incomes. Even in many of the poorest parts of the world, we have luxuries that our ancestors could have only dreamed of. Forget about smartphones and flat-screen TVs — even our richest ancestors would have been jealous of our indoor plumbing, electricity, vaccinations, low child mortality, and long life expectancy.\n\nWe are not heartless. There is still a tremendous amount of extreme poverty in the world. We appreciate that the entire world is not actually “rich” by current or historical standards. But the fact of the matter is that extreme poverty is in rapid decline. This decline began two centuries ago and it has accelerated in recent decades. The trends are striking. Just two centuries ago, 94% of the world lived on less than $2 a day, and 84% lived on less than $1 a day. By 2015, less than 10% of the world lived on less than $1.90 a day, and that number continues to decline. To be clear, 10% of the world is still a lot of people. But as the world continues to become richer, that number will decrease even more.\n\nIt’s not just that there has been a reduction in absolute poverty as the world has grown wealthier. More and more of the world has moved further from the edge of subsistence in the last century. Take, for instance, the relatively arbitrary milestone of $10 per day in 2018 USD. This is not much; $3,650 per year is hardly a king’s ransom. However, in most economies it is more than enough to afford the basics of life (food, shelter, clothing, etc.). This is even more true in relatively poor countries, where modest housing and food can be had cheaply.\n\nHow did the world become rich? Why are some so rich and others so poor? The answers are by no means obvious, and they are the subject of much debate among economists, historians, and other academics. This is reflective of just how important the questions are. To alleviate poverty, we must understand wealth. We still do not have all the answers, but strides have been made toward answering the question: “What do we know about how the world became rich?” Throughout most of world history, a vast majority of the world’s population — well above 90% — was poor. Whether your ancestors are from China, India, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, or elsewhere, the odds are very high that most of them lived on little more than a few dollars a day. That is clearly no longer the case. As stated earlier, the proportion of the world’s population living in extreme poverty has dropped precipitously in the last two centuries. Most of us likely live in some level of comfort, and even the poorest of us would be the envy of their ancestors. After all, they can read! How did the world get to this point? On the surface, the answer to this question is simple: the last two centuries have seen more economic growth than the rest of human history combined. Economic growth refers to a sustained increase in economic prosperity as measured by the total goods and services produced in the economy, commonly referred to as gross domestic product, or GDP. We care about economic growth not because it is an end in itself, but because it is the key to alleviating the type of poverty experienced by almost everyone who lived prior to 1800, and that still plagues way too large of a share of the world’s population today.",
        "Our focus on economic growth does not mean that we don’t value other aspects of human development. Leisure time, long life, good health, literacy, education, female empowerment, and rights and protections for the vulnerable are all central to having a happy and fair society. That said, we believe that all of these features are made possible by economic growth. It is no coincidence that the last 200 years have seen dramatic strides in those very aspects of human development. Even though there is clearly a long way to go to achieve the type of society that most of us want, economic growth will be a key part of the solution.\n\nEconomic growth on its own is not necessarily a panacea. It can be accompanied by environmental degradation, increased inequality, or worsening health outcomes. For instance, air quality declined and life expectancy fell during the British Industrial Revolution. Today, issues such as climate change and social polarization are among the most important challenges that policy-makers face. The point that deserves emphasis here is that economic growth makes available the resources and the new technologies needed to tackle these important challenges. Of course, humanity actually needs to employ these resources to address these challenges. But in the absence of economic growth, we may not have such an opportunity.\n\nIt is a mistake to think that we necessarily have to choose between economic growth and other values. For example, a more unstable climate poses potentially catastrophic risks to our society. Yet, we've seen in recent years that measures to reduce carbon emissions can be accompanied by economic growth. The UK, for example, saw carbon emissions fall by 38% between 1990 and 2017, from 600 million tonnes to 367 million tonnes. Meanwhile, total GDP (adjusted for inflation) increased by over 60% in the same period.\n\nNor do we necessarily have to choose between economic growth and a fairer society. In fact, a lack of economic growth has serious moral downsides. Historically, it is in stagnant or declining economies that one observes the worst episodes of violence, intolerance, and political polarization. On the other hand, social mobility and greater equality of opportunity are much more likely in an economy that is growing. As Benjamin Friedman puts it, stagnant economies “do not breed support for economic mobility, or for openness of opportunity more generally.” So, how has the world economy grown over time? Figure 2 gives some rough estimates of per capita GDP in the world’s most populous regions since the birth of Christ. While these numbers are admittedly speculative — and likely more volatile prior to the 18th century than the figure suggests — the pattern is clear and uncontroversial. Prior to the 19th century, the wealthiest region in the world never reached more than $4 a day average (in 2011 USD). Throughout most of world history, $2-3 a day was the norm. Yes, there were fabulously wealthy people, and these societies produced some of the greatest art, architecture, and literature the world has known (pursuits not generally associated with people on the brink of starvation). These artists and authors are the people from the past you may be the most familiar with, since they are the ones who generally fill our history books. But this was not the lot of almost the entirety of humanity prior to the 19th century. The fact is that most people who ever lived — at least, prior to the 20th century — lived in conditions very similar to those of the very poorest in the world today. The economic growth of the last two centuries has alleviated a vast majority of this poverty, although the job is clearly not finished.\n\nTo be clear, there were spurts of economic improvement here and there in the past. Jack Goldstone calls these “growth efflorescences.” One such period of economic improvement occurred in classical Greece, where there was both population growth and an increase in living standards as measured by the size and quality of homes. Other episodes were due to political pacification, such as the “Pax Islamica” over large parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula in the centuries following.",
        "The spread of Islam. The “Islamic Peace” permitted higher levels of trade and the spread of agricultural techniques and crops. The “Pax Mongolica,” which allowed parts of Asia to thrive in the wake of the Mongol devastations, had similar effects.\n\nAnother cause of temporary economic improvement was widespread death through disease. While plagues were undoubtedly awful for the people who lived through them — in the 14th century, the Black Death killed between a third and a half of Europe’s population and probably a similar amount in the Middle East — they did mean that there were fewer mouths to feed. Per capita income tended to rise for at least a few generations in the wake of these events. The most important cause of economic improvement, however, was technological change. New varieties of disease-resistant grains, new agricultural techniques that improved soil quality or irrigation, and improvements to the plow are all examples of new technologies that allowed more people to be fed with less labor. Yet, prior to the 18th century, all spurts of economic improvement were temporary.\n\nWhat matters in the long run is whether economic growth is continuous, which refers to the continuous growth rates that have been experienced by countries like the US and the UK since the middle of the 19th century. What is unique about developed countries today is not that they have experienced a rapid acceleration of economic growth. Many countries that are poor today have experienced growth accelerations in the past as well. What distinguishes rich countries is that they have not experienced shrinkage. For instance, US GDP has grown fairly constantly since 1870. Even the Great Depression only had a temporary impact on economic growth. The point is that prior to the first few decades of the 19th century, the continuous economic growth experienced by the UK, the US, and other developed economies in the past two centuries was all but unheard of. What was more common was periods of growth offset by periods of contraction, like that experienced by Venezuela between 2011 and 2021. Stephen Broadberry and John Wallis call this “shrinkage.” From this perspective, the main difference between rich and poor countries is not that rich countries grow fast during their periods of growth. Rich countries are those that have experienced fewer periods in which the economy has gotten smaller.\n\nSustained economic growth has been accompanied by a dramatic reorganization of society and production. This is what we refer to as economic development. By this we mean a fundamental and transformative restructuring of the economy associated with urbanization and the growth of non-agricultural sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and the service sector. This process of development was also associated with the emergence of new ways of organizing economic activity: factories, corporations, and stock markets. In contrast, before 1800, the majority of the population lived in the countryside and worked on the land. Sure, there was some variation in urbanization and the prominence of manufacturing or service sectors. In Italy between 0 and 200 CE, urbanization may have been as high as 30%. Iron production soared in Song China. Commerce and long-distance trade were important parts of the economy of late medieval Venice, Bruges, and Antwerp. Nonetheless, the structure of all of these societies was vastly simpler than that of almost any modern economy.\n\nIn the developed world, the structure of the economy is different. Importantly, agriculture has shrunk both as a proportion of the total economy and, even more dramatically, as a source of employment. Today, only 1.3% of the labor force works on the farm in the US. In the UK, the number is smaller still, just 1%. Alongside this structural shift, there has been a transformation in organizational complexity. This is most notably seen in the rise of long-lived organizations independent of the state such as corporations. These are all hallmarks of a developed economy.\n\nYou might wonder: how do we know how poor people were in the past? No country had an office of national statistics collecting information and compiling GDP estimates until the mid-20th century. Instead, social scientists and historians have had to reconstruct the past. The first exercise of this kind was the pioneering work of Angus Maddison. He spent decades creating high-quality estimates of per capita GDP back to 1820. Maddison also produced a set of highly influential estimates for earlier periods, including estimates of per capita income at the regional level for the Roman Empire. But these estimates were of much more questionable veracity. More recent work, including the Maddison project and the work of numerous scholars has produced updated estimates of per capita GDP that are on a much firmer footing.\n\nBut GDP estimates are far from the only source of information we have on past economies. Since the 19th century, economic historians have been collecting information on wages and prices in order to produce estimates of how much an unskilled worker would have been able to purchase in the past. Owing to the work of Robert Allen and others, there now exist comprehensive estimates of the purchasing power of workers for a host of European and Asian cities. Allen’s method is based on the construction of a consumption basket for a representative worker. These baskets are constructed by consulting numerous diaries and the budgets of poor houses and orphanages. A benefit of constructing consumption baskets is that it allows us to compare living standards across time and space, while remaining cognizant that people’s preferences were different in different regions at different times.",
        "Living standards can be calculated as the ratio of yearly wages to the cost of a consumption basket (total cost of food). Whereas rice would have made up a large portion of the Fast Asian diet, grains or bread would take its place in Western Europe.\n\nThere are other measures we can use to assess living standards in the past. One common measure is height. Economic historians have put together estimates of heights for many countries across many centuries. Height is determined by several factors, including genetic endowments. Height is also influenced by in vitro conditions and the nutrition available to the mother during pregnancy and as a child. We observe a strong positive relationship between gains in height and per capita GDP in the past 200 years. People in the past were short. The mean height of an 18 year old in the English army between 1763 and 1767 was 160.76 cm. The increase in average height partly reflects the improvements in nutritional standards achieved since the onset of modern economic growth.\n\nA final measure of the standard of living is F. Modern economic growth is associated with large increases in F. This matters for two reasons. First, increased F represents a significant component of the additional welfare brought about by economic growth. Second, increased F is a possible cause of economic development itself. An increase in F increases the value of investment in human capital, the term economists use to encompass education and other investments in an individual's productive capacity.\n\nThe answer to the question “How did the world become rich?” must explain where, when, and how human societies were able to achieve sustained economic growth. The where and the when we know the answer to: All of the metrics we discussed above agree on this point. It is the third question — how did the escape from stagnation happen — that is so vexing.\n\nBut you would also live in a drafty, uncomfortable castle, and you would likely have multiple children die in infancy.\n\nIf you didn’t die young on the battlefield, odds are you would die of some now-curable disease such as dysentery (which killed English kings John and Henry V), smallpox (which killed French king Louis XV and English queen Mary II), or plague.\n\nOf course, you would have servants, and you'd have the social and political benefits that come with being a member of the upper crust.\n\nSome of us might trade our current lot for that of the baron, but with these risks, many of us would not.\n\nThink about it: would you trade your current life for the life of a wealthy English baron in, say, 1200?",
        "By most measurements, the wealth of the world grew slowly in the past, but it has expanded dramatically in the last few decades, with sharp differences between countries resulting from periods of growth or stagnation. Despite improvements in the overall world economy, many people still live in poverty. Nutrition and overall health have improved, but a lack of sustained positive growth has created sharp differences in consumption. If you lived long ago, you would probably die young, but health conditions are much better now because of a reduction in poverty. In the last few years alone, resources made available by economic growth have increased wealth all over the world. Improvements in the structure of the world economy have brought positive changes to people around the world, especially mobility and openness of opportunity, resulting in a general increase in wealth. Most of the world is rich now, and economic growth is the key to improving everyone's lives. People live longer, there is less chance of getting sick and fewer people have to engage in manufacturing to survive.",

        "In the mid-1990s my wife served as the United Nations human rights officer in Liberia. At the time, I had just started writing for the magazine New York, and my editor did not have the Liberian civil war high on his list of most urgent topics. But I was lucky — my editor was understanding enough to let me write about the war for The New York Times Magazine, my first legitimate foreign assignment.\n\nEverything about the Liberian civil war was unusual and terrible and fascinating. I was especially taken, though, by the Liberian press — a group of reporters, editors, and photographers who were aggressive, clever, and determined. There was not enough food in Monrovia, no clean water, barely any electricity, yet the press somehow found enough ink and paper to produce some astonishing journalism.\n\nThe strange thing is that, after all this time, it is an advertisement from these Liberian papers that I remember most clearly. It was an ad that helped me understand — in a real lightning strike of understanding — the best way to approach magazine writing and editing, which I was just then learning.\n\nThe ad was for a local butcher shop and read “All Parts of the Cow.” “All Parts of the Cow” has stayed with me for almost thirty years because it became the way I explain the difference between newspaper writing and magazine writing.\n\nLike many magazine people, I started in newspapers, and I loved the work: the adrenaline, the urgency, the high-pressure collaboration. When I was a novice reporter on the night police beat at The Washington Post, I once left the newsroom at four a.m., wandered to the basement pressroom, and grabbed an actually hot-off-the-presses copy of the morning’s paper, one with my signed article on the front page. At the bottom, but never mind. It still felt great.\n\nWhat I’m about to say is not meant to be a criticism of newspapers or newspaper people. Obviously, newspapers, especially the big national papers, are stuffed with creative, brave, and talented people who are also, by the way, helping to save our democracy, which is no small thing.\n\nThe problem I had was twofold: First was the amount of clichés. On the police desk, we joked that the city had only two types of streets: “quiet, tree-lined streets” or “trash-scattered, drug-plagued streets.” I once made a joke about it, but he didn’t have time to get the joke.\n\nCliché is everywhere, especially in writing. Clichés are one of the prices we pay in journalism for speed, but alertness and a brisk pre-edit scrub will eliminate most of them.\n\nThe second problem: In newspaper editing it is common to remove wild feeling, weird detail, irregular observation, and the disturbing dynamics of writers interacting with their subjects and the world. A smart New Yorker editor, the late John Bennet, once told me that the real bias in journalism is toward consistency, and though there are other biases — of course — this seemed undoubtedly true. This unexamined bias causes us to think that stories have beginnings, middles, and endings, that all questions must be answered, and that everything that happens in the universe happens for a reason.\n\nMagazine people, generally speaking, have a different understanding: Not every story has an ending; not every story even has a beginning. Not everything has to make sense. Not everything is knowable. And most importantly, something that always and forever adds confusion and complexity to story making: The presence of writers (and their experiences, beliefs, personalities, histories, and dispositions) inevitably changes the reality of whatever the writers are observing and describing. “Put it in, put it all in,” is an efficient way to describe this style of editing. Another way to describe it: “All parts of the cow.”\n\nLast year, when I asked Jennifer Senior, who had just joined the staff of The Atlantic, if she had anything original to say about the twentieth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (originality traditionally being scarce on anniversaries of world-historical events), she thought for a minute and then said, “Maybe, but it’s complicated.” The story she sketched for me then was something more than complicated. It was exquisitely personal, and it featured — of all people — a 9/11 truther, “A good man,” Jen said, something never previously said by sane people about 9/11 truthers. We talked and talked and talked. And then I thought, “All parts of the cow,” and I said, “Let’s try it.” Just put it all in. And then Jen and her editor, Scott Stossel, made something magical happen, and we published her story and it won the National Magazine Award for Feature Writing and the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Jen, Scott, and I realized, late in the process, that the story didn’t even have anything resembling a nut graf — a term, borrowed from newspapering, for the paragraph that explains why you, the reader, should continue reading this story. Sometimes a magazine piece is so magnetic that the entire thing is its own nut graf, and this was true in Jen’s case.",
        "by then, though, I had really started caring about my sentences, and I was worried about the limitations of newspapering. I don’t remember if this was the name of the butcher shop or its marketing slogan or simply a statement of fact, but it doesn’t matter. I learned, over time, that the best magazine editors don’t fear complication but run to it. I’m no great sentence maker, but I wanted — and still want — to try to be one, and I hoped to work for people who wanted me to try. it’s impossible to describe, except to say that it contains all the mess of life and that it is written like poetry but in prose. self-distancing, of the sort we see to good effect in professional newspaper reporters, has its place.",
        "Our perception of time is anything but constant. Two new studies suggest our heartbeat can cause passing moments to feel either slower or faster. The experiments, led by separate research groups, have uncovered corresponding findings. Together, their work confirms that the heart’s activity influences our perception of time as it passes. They show that we can’t look at the experience of time in isolation from the body.\n\nIn April 2023, a group of neuroscientists led by Irena Arslanova of Royal Holloway, University of London, reported that time perception changes with each heartbeat. In their experiment, 28 people learned to distinguish the duration of two visual or two auditory stimuli. For example, the study participants looked at two shapes or heard two distinct tones. One item or sound from each pair was presented for 200 milliseconds, and the other lasted for 400 milliseconds.\n\nNext, people saw a new cue — another tone or shape — and had to estimate how the presentation felt shorter or longer, using the previous pair for reference. But there was an added twist. These new sounds and shapes were matched with a particular moment in the rhythm of someone’s heart rate: when the heart either contracted (the systole) or relaxed (the diastole) during the heartbeat. During systole, the volunteers perceived time duration to be shorter than it actually was. During diastole, the exact opposite was true.\n\nAccording to Arslanova and her colleagues, the phenomenon may be explained by the fact that pressure sensors in blood vessel walls send signals to the brain and affect its capacity to process incoming information. This increase in sensory impressions could make time feel longer. A similar finding was published in March 2023 by a group of researchers at Cornell University, who focused on differences in time perception between single heartbeats. When that span is longer, they discovered, time feels slower. When there is more time between two beats, time seems to move faster.\n\nResearchers from both groups caution that those experiences are influenced by many factors, including our emotion and attention. They also happen at a totally different scale. As Adam K. Anderson, one of the authors of the March study, explains, however, the new work illuminates how the heart influences the experience of time as it unfolds. He confirms that how the body and brain relate is of growing interest in neuroscience. “People are comfortable with the idea that the brain can influence what the heart does,” he says. But reversing that relationship is novel and really fascinating. “Your brain,” he adds, “might be listening to patterns in your heart to shape something as fundamentally significant as the passage of time.”\n\nMy mother had raised me vegetarian, and though I harbored no real desire to eat meat, sometimes, in summer, I would take a large piece of watermelon to a remote corner of our yard and pretend it was a fresh dead animal. On all fours, I would bury my face in the sweet red fruit-meat and bite into it. Sometimes, I’d rip handfuls out and stuff them in my mouth, which wasn’t much like the way any animal I knew of ate. I was less playing a particular kind of animal than enacting a form of wildness that I recognized in myself.\n\nI watched Wild America, a PBS show on which conservationist Marty Stouffer revealed the wildness of the animal world. Alone in the woods behind our house, I had beaten my chest, acted out my own invented stories without a thought to how another’s gaze might see me. I sympathized with the restless business of squirrels and wild obsessions of our golden retriever. I was embarrassed by forks and knives — why they should exist when we had such perfect instruments at the ends of our arms.\n\nHowever often Stouffer imposed human narratives on the animals depicted (very often), it was still always clear that survival was the priority that assigned value to everything in the animal world. If the wild marten was overcome by her own feelings, she didn’t let it stop her from getting dinner for her babies. I learned in elementary school that we were animals, but unlike other animals we did not seem driven by the instinct for physical survival. My teachers emphasized the continuity, but we were so far up the food chain that survival was no longer even visible to us. We were beyond survival, in a dark and sky-high realm where our instincts had been twisted into atrocities like capitalism and hair removal. I might not have been able to name this, but I recognized it.",
        "My love for walking started in childhood, out of necessity. I didn’t want to stay at home. I found every reason to stay away from home and was usually out — at some friend’s house or at a street party where no kids should be — until it was too late to get public transportation. So I walked.\n\nThe streets of Kingston, Jamaica, in the 1980s were often terrifying, but I made friends with strangers. The beggar, the vendor, the poor laborer — those were experienced wanderers, and they became my nighttime instructors; they knew the streets and delivered lessons on how to explore and enjoy them. The streets had their own safety: Unlike at home, there I could be myself without fear. Walking became so regular and familiar that the way home became home.\n\nThe streets had their rules, and I loved the challenge of trying to master them. I learned how to be alert to surrounding dangers and nearby delights, and I prided myself on recognizing significant details that my peers missed. Kingston was a map of complex, and often bizarre, cultural and political and social activity, and I appointed myself its nighttime mapmaker.\n\nI left Jamaica in 1996 to attend college in New Orleans, a city I’d heard called “the northernmost Caribbean city.” I wanted to discover — on foot, of course — what was Caribbean and what was American about it.\n\nOn my first day in the city, I went walking for a few hours to get a feel for the place and to buy supplies to transform my dormitory room into a welcoming space. When some university staff members found out what I’d been up to, they advised me to restrict my walking to the places recommended as safe to tourists and the parents of new students. They mentioned statistics about New Orleans’s crime rate. But Kingston’s crime rate far exceeded those numbers, and I decided to ignore these well-meant cautions. A city was waiting to be discovered, and I wouldn’t let inconvenient facts get in the way. These American criminals are nothing compared to Kingston’s, I thought. They’re no real threat to me.\n\nWhat no one prepared me for was who would be considered a threat.\n\nWithin days I noticed that many people on the street seemed afraid of me: Some gave me a glance as they approached, and then crossed the street; others, ahead, would glance behind, notice my presence, and then speed up; older white women clutched their bags; young white men nervously greeted me, as if exchanging a salutation for their safety: “What’s up, bro?” On one occasion, less than a month after my arrival, I tried to help a man whose wheelchair was stuck in the middle of a street; he threatened to shoot me in the face, then asked a white person for help.\n\nI wasn’t prepared for any of this. I had come from a majority-black country in which no one was wary of me because of my skin color. Now I wasn’t sure who was afraid of me. I was especially unprepared for the cops. They regularly stopped and questioned me, asking questions that took my guilt for granted. I'd never received what many of my African American friends call “The Talk”: No parents had told me how to behave when I was stopped by the police, how to be as polite and cooperative as possible, no matter what they said or did to me.\n\nMy survival tactics began. In this city of energetic streets, walking became a complex and often oppressive negotiation. I would see a white woman walking toward me at night and cross the street to reassure her that she was safe. I would forget something at home but not immediately turn around if someone was behind me, because I discovered that a sudden turn could cause alarm. New Orleans suddenly felt more dangerous than Jamaica. Despite my best efforts, the streets never felt comfortably safe. Even a simple salutation was suspect.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina hit the area, my aunt persuaded me to come to stay in New York City. I explored the city with friends, and then with a woman I'd begun dating. She walked around endlessly with me, taking in New York City’s many pleasures. My impressions of the city took shape during my walks with her. But it wasn’t long before reality reminded me I wasn’t safe, especially when I walked alone.\n\nOne night in the East Village, I was running to dinner when a white man in front of me turned and suddenly punched me in the chest. I assumed he was drunk or had mistaken me for an old enemy, but found out soon enough that he’d merely assumed I was a criminal because of my race. When he discovered I wasn’t a threat, he went on to tell me that his assault was my own fault for running up behind him. I returned to the old rules I’d set for myself in New Orleans.\n\nI’m still trying to arrive in a city that isn’t quite mine. One definition of home is that it’s somewhere we can most be ourselves. And when are we more ourselves but when walking, that natural state in which we repeat one of the first actions we learned? A foot leaves, a foot lands, and our longing gives it momentum from rest to rest. We long to look, to think, to talk, to get away. But more than anything else, we long to be free. We want the freedom and pleasure of walking without fear — without others’ fear — wherever we choose. I’ve lived in New York City for almost a decade and have not stopped walking its fascinating streets. And I still long to find the comfort that I found as a kid on the streets of Kingston.",
        "After living in the United States for a while, the author realizes that Kingston, New Orleans, and New York City do not differ much in terms of safety. Being able to walk the streets of a city without fear or concern is a significant source of freedom for the author. For the author, walking is an act of rebellion against racism and the police. Walking in U.S. cities is not a stressful experience for the author because he is used to paying attention to every move he makes on the street. While living in Kingston, the author feels equally comfortable at his childhood home and on the city’s various streets."
