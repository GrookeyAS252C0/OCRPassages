        "In the brief span between 1846 and 1867, two discoveries swept away the two quandaries that had haunted traditional surgery — the pain during surgery and the threat of infections after surgery — thus allowing cancer surgeons to revisit the bold procedures that John Hunter, the father of modern surgery, had previously tried to perfect in London.\n\nThe first of these discoveries, anesthesia, was demonstrated in 1846 in a packed surgical amphitheater at Massachusetts General Hospital, less than ten miles from where Sidney Farber's basement laboratory would be located a century later. At about ten o'clock on the morning of October 16, a group of doctors gathered in a pitlike room at the center of the hospital. A Boston dentist, William Morton, unveiled a small glass vaporizer, containing about a quart of ether, fitted with an inhaler. He opened the nozzle and asked the patient, Edward Abbott, to take a few whiffs of the vapor. As Abbott lolled into a deep sleep, a surgeon stepped into the center of the amphitheater and, with a few brisk strokes, deftly made a small incision in Abbott’s neck and closed a swollen, malformed blood vessel with a quick stitch. When Abbott awoke a few minutes later, he said, “I did not experience pain at any time, though I knew that the operation was proceeding.” Anesthesia — the disassociation of pain from surgery — enabled surgeons to perform prolonged operations, often lasting several hours. But the hurdle of postsurgical infection remained. Until the mid-nineteenth century, such infections were common and universally lethal, but their cause remained a mystery. “It must be some subtle principle contained in the wound,” one surgeon concluded in 1819, “which eludes the sight.”\n\nThe concept of the “week” occupies an important place in our minds. The fact that, as children, we learn about “the weekend” long before we become acquainted with either “June” or “the 14th” indicates that the weekly organization of our environment may be far more salient to us than either its annual or monthly structure. When making plans for a particular date, we usually first check on what day it falls. Much of our social environment is structured along weekly patterns. In order to navigate successfully within society, we require a sort of mental “temporal map” that informs us, for example, that the best day for spending a relaxing morning with our parents is Sunday, that museums are often closed on Mondays, and that there are reduced rates for long-distance telephone calls on weekends. Without such a “map,” we may avoid Saturday nights at movie theaters, Fridays at banks, and Saturday afternoons at supermarkets and department stores. Such a “map” also serves to remind me that, if I wish to have a long telephone conversation with a particular friend, I should avoid calling him on Wednesday evenings, when he regularly watches his favorite television show.\n\nRecalling what day of the week it is today is one of the first things we usually do upon waking, since it is indispensable for transcending our subjectivity and participating — at least mentally — in a social, rather than a merely personal, world. But with this comes well-justified anxiety about being barred from full participation in our social environment. In other words, adhering to the week protects us from the dreadful prospect of practical exile from the social world.",
        "The field of machine learning comprises three major areas: In unsupervised learning, a machine is simply given a heap of data and told to make sense of it, to find patterns, regularities, useful ways of condensing or representing or visualizing it. In supervised learning, the system is given a series of categorized or labeled examples and told to make predictions about new examples it hasn't seen yet, or for which the ground truth is not yet known. And in reinforcement learning, the system is placed into an environment with rewards and punishments and told to figure out the best way to minimize the punishments and maximize the rewards.\n\nOn all three fronts, there is a growing sense that more and more of the world is being turned over, in one way or another, to these mathematical and computational models. Though they range widely in complexity — from something that might fit on a spreadsheet on the one hand, to something that might credibly be called artificial intelligence on the other — they are steadily replacing both human judgment and explicitly programmed software of the more traditional variety.\n\nMyanmar’s Rohingya people experienced genocide gradually, then suddenly. Decades of increasing human rights restrictions came to global attention in 2017, with a brutal army-led “clearance operation” within Rohingya communities. Claiming to be searching for militants in the northern reaches of Rakhine state, the Myanmar military engaged in scorched-earth tactics that targeted civilian populations, razed hundreds of Rohingya villages with fire, murdered at least 9,000 Rohingya men, and unleashed a monstrous campaign of sexual violence against Rohingya women and girls. These atrocities precipitated the largest forced migration in the region since the Second World War, with more than 700,000 Rohingya fleeing Myanmar in terror for the relative safety of Bangladesh, which has welcomed them. Already extremely poor Rohingya refugees arrived in Bangladesh on foot carrying whatever possessions they could — cooking pots, sometimes rice, the occasional portable solar panel, and often infants and enfeebled elderly relatives. The Rohingya living outside of Myanmar and in refugee camps in Bangladesh are commonly undocumented, making it necessary to rely upon estimates when assessing the overall size of the diaspora population. They also came with blood-curdling accounts of the sexual violence unleashed by Myanmar’s military, and of how army helicopters were used to spread fire through the Rohingya’s largely bamboo villages.\n\nAlong Bangladesh's border with Myanmar, land that had been unoccupied in late August through October had become a cramped shanty city of bamboo, tarpaulin and mud that stretched into the horizon. These new camps, within weeks of being established, became home to more people than cities the size of Dublin or Washington, DC. Humanitarian agencies struggled to provide food, water and sanitation necessary for the rapidly growing and severely traumatized population.",
        "Monsters draw our attention to place. From the geographies that produce monsters, to the public and private spaces that are breached by them, place is in large part what makes monsters scary. There are many reasons why we may be afraid of a monster — its monstrous body, the deepest fears it represents, the harm it wishes upon us — but our dread is greatly amplified when that monster is in the closet. Or under the bed. When it approaches the outskirts of town. Or lumbers down the street. Place and monsters — place and our sense of the monstrous — are inextricably intertwined. Teaching monsters thus requires the teaching of place.\n\nIn their book Mapping American Culture, Wayne Franklin and Michael Steiner write, “Place is a powerful though often unacknowledged condition of experience. Life does not exist in a vacuum: everything takes place, from sweeping historical events to the most private occurrences.” In a similar vein, monsters “take place.” On both macro and micro levels, whether they are destroying a city or lurking under the stairs of your home, monsters shape and are shaped by location. Studying monsters provides students with an opportunity to “acknowledge” place, and to explore the ways in which undifferentiated spaces become fearful places when endowed with monstrous qualities.\n\nTo study monsters is to study how monstrous identities are codified in certain spaces (Dracula and Transylvania, for instance, or the Creature from the Black Lagoon). It also compels analysis of the organization, construction, destruction, and representation of monstrous space — analysis of what happens to Tokyo when Godzilla rampages, for example, or to the shopping mall when overrun by zombies. In other words, studying monsters requires the mapping of social relations: discovering how identities, ideologies, and power dynamics are inscribed on the landscape and transformed by the presence of imaginary beasts. I suggest four ways we might conceptualize and map monstrous geographics when teaching monsters in the classroom: (1) monsters and the imagined community, (2) monsters and nature, (3) monsters and the built environment, (4) monsters and political geography.\n\nI did not originally intend my “American Monsters” course to focus so much on space and place. Initially, my main goal was to create a seminar that gave advanced undergraduates and graduate students an opportunity to analyze monsters as windows onto particular historical moments, from the colonial era to the present, and to see how imaginary creatures resonated with social concerns in the past. However, as my inaugural semester proceeded, I quickly realized that the texts I assigned and the subsequent discussions we had about these narratives repeatedly converged on the theme of spatiality. Where these monsters came from, where they went, the landscapes they threatened and changed — time and again, these details mattered in uncovering what exactly made these monsters scary and what made them resonate in specific historical eras. Halfway through the semester, I decided to focus more intentionally on space and place in order to make “American Monsters” as much a primer on cultural geography as it was a primer on monsters and the monstrous.",
        "A revised educational system enforced the Tokyo dialect as the hyōjungo or standard language of classroom and textbook. Air stewardess has been replaced by flight-attendant, gaijin has been replaced by gaikokujin, the kanji collocation is being replaced by the insertion of a neutralizing hiragana pronounced the same way. In nation-states of the world, the enforcement of linguistic conformity — proper language, standard language — continues to dominate educational and administrative policy. Since that time, a new but somewhat vague concept, kyōtsū-go or ‘common language’, has been introduced, which tries to take account of the fact that dialectal varieties exist and may not be such a bad thing. The implementation of a centralized bureaucracy was a paramount goal of the Meiji Government in its drive towards modernization. The term ‘dialect complex’ was introduced in sociolinguistics to describe a speaker’s sense of interiority regarding the regional dialect. There appears to be a clear link between the nationalism of Germany and the bureaucratic language policy making which was just starting in Meiji era Japan. Thus, every linguistic interaction is itself the reproduction of social structure.\n\nSociolinguistics is a disciplinary framework that examines the social and political conditions of situated encounters and exchange between agents who are endowed with social experience, socially structured resources and competencies that underpin language formation and use. One set of structures involves public shame, offense, avoidance and prohibition. The role of sociolinguistics is to examine the stratification of language and the structure of linguistic prejudice as reflected in popular judgments; expressions are ‘unacceptable’ or ‘rude’ or ‘beautiful’. Sociolinguistics must reconcile the essentially neutral or arbitrary nature of linguistic difference and of linguistic change, on the one hand, with the social stratification of language and levels of speech unmistakable in any complex community, on the other. Landmarks in the history of language standardization are well known.\n\nIn the contemporary world, language hygiene has replaced official institutional mechanisms for language control. Former language practices, now unacceptable, linger in the sociolinguistic memory.\n\nThe belief that language is in a critical state of decadence was an important factor in the pursuit of standardization. The use of a so-called ‘language of high culture’ created from a hegemonic single dialect of one city is characterized by a heightened grammatical and etymological consciousness, and submission to rule and authority. Thus, a ‘language of high culture’ can be contrasted with the concept of an ‘uncivilized’ one which, in the process of modernization, becomes cultivated or domesticated for the purpose of yielding return. The pursuit of a ‘common language’ reached its peak in the 19th-century nationalist ideologies which took shape in Japan’s Meiji government, along with increasingly centralized national bureaucracies in Germany or France. ‘To possess one common language became a crucial symbol in the establishment of nationalist ideologies. The philosophical and poetical pursuit of the Romantic belief in National Spirit climaxed in Fascist ascendancies in Germany, Italy and Japan. The national language, as the identifying mark of a state and the mother of its people, must be respected and protected.\n\nThe establishment of Tokyo speech as a starting point for standardization by no means began with the Meiji period. The Meiji ruling elite created hyōjungo ‘standard language’ for the nation. They renamed Japanese language and Japanese literature as kokugo ‘national language’ and kokubungaku ‘national literature’ to symbolize uniformity in Japanese language and culture. Thus, with the relocation of political and bureaucratic power to the new capital of Japan Edo the hegemony of the Tokyo dialect was complete. The notorious hogen fuda or ‘dialect placard’ was hung around students who used their regional dialect in school. The Meiji administration's design for a unified common language set the nation on a march towards homogeneity under the guise of national unity. The intensity of the national drive towards cultural and linguistic homogeneity continued up to the end of the war. This gave rise to dialect discrimination and over a period of almost 100 years, the Japanese people were told that dialects were bad and ugly and had to be eradicated, that good Japanese citizens should not use dialects under any circumstances and that the very existence of varying dialects around Japan was a shame to the sovereignty of the nation. The notion gradually emerged that speakers of different dialects can communicate with each other by continuing to use versions of their dialects modified according to an ‘ideal form’ based in turn on the Tokyo dialect.",
        "Miles: Hey, what do you think about this whole AT thing? Emma: Yeah, it seems like everyone's talking about it these days.\n\nMiles: I know. It’s everywhere! Emma: I feel like I'm getting left behind. I know nothing about it.\n\nMiles: You should, Emma. It can do some amazing stuff.\n\nEmma: Such as? Miles: Like, it can beat humans at chess and even make great art! Emma: True, but don’t you worry about it? I think it’s scary.\n\nMiles: Haha, seriously! It’s not all doom and gloom. AI can help doctors diagnose diseases and even make the perfect cup of coffee! Emma: Coffee? Now you're talking! But what about job losses? Miles: Good point. Some jobs might vanish, but we'll create new ones! Better ones.\n\nEmma: Yeah, that may be so. But what if AI starts telling us what to do? Miles: That’s not true. It’s here to make our lives easier, not weirder.\n\nEmma: I, for one, don’t want my fridge telling me what to eat! Those who possess a sense of values will esteem art, thought, and knowledge for their own sakes, not for their possible utility. When I say for their own sakes, I mean, of course, as direct means to good states of mind which alone are good as ends. No one now imagines that a work of art lying on an uninhabited island has absolute value, or doubts that its potential value lies in the fact that it can at any moment become a means to a state of mind of superlative excellence. Works of art being direct means to aesthetic ecstasy are direct means to good. And the disinterested pursuit and perception of scientific and philosophical truth, as they provoke analogous states of emotional intensity, may be assigned to the same class. Knowledge, however, is not, properly speaking, a direct means to good; its action is remote. Knowledge is a food of infinite potential value which must be assimilated by the intellect and imagination before it can become positively valuable. Only when it has been so assimilated does it become a direct means to good states of mind. It is the nourishing quality in knowledge that people with a sense of values most esteem. What is peculiar to civilized people is, in the first place, that they are capable of recognizing the value of knowledge as a means to exquisite spiritual states, and, in the second, that they esteem this value above any remote, utilitarian virtue.\n\nSUMMARY: The difference between art appreciation and knowledge is that art is directly valuable while knowledge requires assimilation to become valuable."

        "At Sport is not simply about who wins or loses the game. While events on the field of play may define the limits of the actual physical sporting experience, the impact of sport is felt far wider. In 1950, for example, Brazil was the host nation, and hot favourite, for that year’s soccer World Cup. They faced Uruguay in the final, in front of 200,000 supporters. The Uruguayans silenced the home crowd, scoring the winning goal, with 11 minutes remaining, to win 2-1. In trying to explain the shock of the defeat for Brazilians, the writer Nelson Rodriguez noted, ‘Every nation has its own irredeemable catastrophe, something like Hiroshima. Our catastrophe, our Hiroshima, was the defeat by Uruguay in 1950.’ The comparison, while trying to capture the psychological effect on Brazilian pride, is ridiculous in terms of the human cost. Rodriguez was trying to make the point, albeit insensitively, that in moments such as these sport can profoundly affect people’s lives and expose the frailties of the national consciousness.\n\nAs schoolchildren, spectators, players, or simply as consumers of media, we are all exposed to sport every day. Given the ethical values that were enshrined in the origins of modern sport, the constant valorization of fair play and sportsmanship by contemporary sports organizations and the media, the games we play and watch are supposed to be ‘good’ things. However, sport has always had its dark side. Many of the ills apparent in society have historically manifested themselves in and around sport and, considering the media, have been magnified.\n\nIn his essay entitled Germany and its Tribes, Roman historian Tacitus provides a painstaking description of Rome's enemies to the north. A good indicator of how Romans viewed their northern neighbors, the essay portrays Germanic barbarians as a sort of noble savage — courageous in battle but totally unappreciative of the finer things in life; religious in custom but incapable of higher thinking; dirty and smelly but hospitable and honest.\n\nA modern historian expressed the Roman view of barbarians as people who “did not have a history but were simply part of the flow of natural history.” That is, unlike the “civilized” Greeks and Romans, barbarians didn’t make history; history happened to them, as it does to, say, monkeys and apes. This depiction of the barbarians has remained generally intact for more than two millennia.\n\nAnother mistake made about Germanic barbarians over the ages has been the tendency to group all tribes together on the assumption that barbarians were all the same. Tacitus and his contemporaries — and, by extension, we in the present era — tend to speak of barbarians as a single group, when in fact northern European tribes, although holding many similarities, maintained certain differences in terms of religious practice, social customs, burial rites, and political practices.\n\nJust prior to and during the Migration Period (300-700 A.D.), which marks the height of the northern tribes’ incursion into the Roman Empire and beyond, the divide among tribes became even sharper. Different tribes had different goals regarding the Roman Empire, but the Goths stood out from the rest in their eagerness to attain peace with the Romans and gain acceptance into the Empire.",
        "Some mammals (whales, dolphins, fur seals, sea lions) sleep with one hemisphere of the brain being asleep while the other is awake. This is referred to as unihemispheric slow-wave sleep (USWS) and contrasts with the bihemispheric slow-wave sleep (BSWS) exhibited by humans and other mammals. Whales and dolphins show only USWS. Northern fur seals and sea lions are aquatic and terrestrial. While in water these animals have USWS, like whales, but on land they have both USWS and BSWS. It is unclear whether whales, like humans, have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas we know that seals and sea lions have REM sleep on land, and it is always bilateral. Some birds also have USWS, but neurochemicals related to USWS have only been measured in the fur seal. The evolutionary basis of USWS is unclear. The discovery of unihemispheric sleep is a boon to sleep research as it provides a unique opportunity to empirically test neural circuit models of sleep-wake regulation.\n\nAll biographies are interpretations of their subjects. The best biographers compose accounts that make use of every possible resource of representation that narrative can offer. They are concerned with a judicious presentation of the facts of a life but also, much more important, with devising a form, a style, an attitude, and a perspective that can come as close as a book may do to paralleling the life of its subject. If this is done well enough, the book can truly resemble the man or woman it is describing.\n\nThe biographer is the life’s second author or, perhaps, its editor. A biography of John Dewey demands that its author represent Dewey as and how he lived. Because Dewey’s main occupation in life was thinking, his biographer must not only write about Dewey’s thought but also reflect and inquire with Dewey into the processes of thinking. Dewey’s main entry into the life of thought was through his emotions. He was not a thinking machine but a vibrant person-who-thought. His biographer can succeed only if he, too, conveys in his own narrative the continuous activity of Dewey's strong emotions.\n\nDewey was one person. But he prepared many faces to meet the opportunities offered by both his own inner capacities and the possibilities of his time and place. For philosophers, he was a philosopher, immensely learned and technically brilliant. For those people engaged with issues of education, whether experts in the field or anguished parents, he was the leading exponent of the new learning. For the citizenry, he was an advocate and combatant in the rough-and-tumble of American politics, public affairs, and public policy, as well as a powerful controversialist for liberal causes. Dewey moved effortlessly from any one of these roles to the others.",
        "As Stephen of Hungary counselled his successor in the eleventh century, ‘The utility of foreigners and guests is so great that they can be given a place of sixth importance among the royal ornaments’.\n\nEnglish, as seen by those who did not acquire it as a mother tongue, has been characterized in an astonishing variety of ways: unimportant, invasive, empowering, destructive are among the words used to describe it.\n\nFourteenth-century texts are unique in that they reveal a complex interface of languages.\n\nIn recognizing that the past is often like the present, we need to search backwards for evidence of this process of accommodation.\n\nModern multilinguals look with surprise on those who believe that a single language will serve them better than several.\n\nOld English already had a word for the crucial social role of the translator — wealhsiod — who stood at the interface of two languages.\n\nOld-fashioned language histories have often endeavoured to look at a ‘national’ language as if it were a single ‘and triumphant’ result of some Darwinian process of selection.\n\nThe Bible, for example, relates a linguistic miracle that took place in the first century AD when the followers of Jesus suddenly became fluent in the languages of the many visitors to and residents of Jerusalem.\n\nMultilingualism is, and has been, a normal part of social life for most people, both now and in the past. They can hardly imagine so isolated an existence as implied by one language or barely believe that monolinguals can be satisfied by talking to people identical, more or less, to themselves.\n\nEnglish is and has been one language among many. The ebb and flow of enthusiasm for other languages within the anglophone community is a tale of profound cultural importance for the history of English. Yet both sides of the linguistic divide are important. In Britain, abroad has been seen as sometimes repugnant, sometimes frightening — ‘that beastly abroad’, wrote one nineteenth-century novelist quoted by the Oxford English Dictionary. Mistrust and suspicion is not the exclusive property of English-speakers, however.\n\nIn the past, heightened social value accrued around the possession of more languages than one. This involved no fewer than fifteen languages. The surprise was the clarity of the speech of those miraculously made fluent, a startling improvement on the halting approximations or pidgin contact languages which had been usual in that multilingual city. Even if this story is regarded as metaphorical rather than historical, it presumes a culture in which a diversity of languages is entirely normal. Moreover, he added, ‘a country unified in language and customs is fragile and weak’. Stephen’s view seems to have been commonplace in political thinking at the time that English emerged as a distinct language within the cluster of West Germanic dialects. Bede began his Ecclesiastical History of the English Peoples by describing the linguistic riches of eighth-century Britain and celebrating the fact that five languages were in use. Until quite recently, the prevailing opinion has been the more languages, the better.\n\nThis view ignores the abundance of languages and language varieties except insofar as they were swept up and carried forward by the inevitable rise of the national ‘standard’. More recently, approaches to the ‘ecology’ of communities have instead demonstrated the value of describing the facts of language life for all people living in earlier times and places. People at the interface of two (or more) languages ‘accommodate’ to each other and thus create new linguistic identities. Twenty-first-century society is not so different to those of earlier times. The many languages of Manchester or Miami, Cape Town or Canberra, can easily be matched in the much smaller settlements of medieval Colchester or renaissance Cardiff. In all of these communities, a dynamic interaction among languages and dialects produced new forms of expression.\n\nBefore written records became common, it is difficult to discern just what balance among languages might have been struck in the early history of the British Isles. Place-names can still attest the kinds of linguistic layering which often took place. London, for example, traces its own history into English from the Latin Londinium, which is itself supposed to be based on a Celtic personal or tribal name, Londinos. Complex multilingualism was prevalent in Anglo-Saxon England. In Middle English too, multilingualism remained a significant fact about language use in Britain even though, following the Norman Conquest, the individual language components of such multilingualism had decisively changed.",
        "Good heavens! Are you a ghost from the world beyond? Indeed, I am. And what, pray tell, are you doing out at this late hour? You must agree that it is a fine night for a stroll. Isn’t that why you've wandered out here? I'm searching for some insights with which to contemplate the nature of existence. In that case, please don’t let me get in your way. I shall retire to the church. Well, come to think of it, I could benefit from your insights. Stay with me a while. As you wish. Now, tell me, what aspect of existence most puzzles you? It’s all this talk of fate, of destiny, and their supposed influence over our future. Nonsense, all of it! It is the ever-changing combination of accidental circumstances and the fickle operation of free will which determines one’s future — nothing more. And am I simply to wait for it? Or have you some conclusive evidence? Why, I’m a ghost, am I not? I possess supernatural understanding of a wide variety of things. Prove it. Well, I happen to know that you will live to be ninety-eight years old. You have no choice. You're contradicting yourself! Then it’s just as I feared: fate presides over our future. You may be right, after all.\n\nDiversity is sometimes given a worse reputation than it deserves. Certain people insist that the term signifies nothing more than difference, and so to call ourselves diverse is to separate ourselves, to undermine community. How unfortunate, especially in a democracy, that we fail to note how insistently diversity also points to unity. When we call Americans diverse, we are saying they are all Americans, equal members of the category. Like democracy, diversity encourages us to establish a unifying context, a community of meaning and action in which individual differences can thrive and strengthen the community that nurtures them. However, opponents of diversity in higher education often argue that it denies opportunity to deserving individuals just to make room for those less qualified. But the facts contradict the argument and demonstrate that American higher education has typically accommodated newcomers by enrolling larger numbers of students. As a result, those who had previously been disproportionately privileged — white, upper-class, male students — suffered no real disadvantage. At the end of the twentieth century at Wesleyan University, an elite institution in the United States, for example, there were more white male students than there were in 1956. In the 1990s, some students were stunned by such statistics, but not because they were unfamiliar with the institution's recent commitment to diversity — many had applied for that reason. Rather, they had never considered the possibility that admission to the university might have been out of reach for their own parents.\n\nDespite some negative views about diversity, in reality ..."

        "Anti-nuclear movements become prominent features of advanced industrial societies in the 1970s as the use of nuclear power with electricity generation expanded. The act of recounting what have happened introduces a degree of ambiguity into history because different perspectives create different histories. Given the constant and cumulative nature of microaggressions, it’s important to find outside help, especially if there’s a power imbalance or if push back puts you at risk or in danger.\n\nAlong with the promotion of higher wages and skill development, the “Respect for Diversity and Flexibility of Choice” policy calls for the creation of an environment which people can work regardless of their gender and ensure flexibility. It takes work to unlearn the many fraught words and phrases in our cultural lexicon, but most people find it’s not that difficult to do once they set their minds to actively being more inclusive.\n\nAmong international relations scholars, there has been many debate on the consequences of the end of the Cold War for war and peace in the international system. The post-9/11 challenge to sovereignty is organized and led by a hegemonic state which is seeking simultaneous to safeguard and limit Westphalian sovereignty to suit its particular interests. No biologist has ever been able to provide a satisfactory definition of “race” — that is, a definition that includes all members of a given race and excludes all others. Meanwhile, the world’s existing production capacity of both oil and gas are already close to being fully used. Such quandaries might suggest that ethical issues should be left to other social scientists, but that division of labour would be untenable.",
        "Several studies show communication skills are the most essential skills for navigating American adult life — better communicators are hired more often, enjoy happier relationships and marriages, ascend to leadership positions, and possess higher self-esteem. The ability to manage personal emotions and to recognize them in others is a predictor of academic and professional success.\n\nThese skills are often taught through Social Emotional Learning programs, offered in K-12 schools in 27 states. But they are also a by-product of theater class, according to a recent study from George Mason University and the Commonwealth Theatre Center. The study follows children aged 5 to 18 over six years — the longest look at theater’s impact on kids to date — and finds increases in communication skills across age, gender, and race. “The longer the kids spent in the theater classes, the more they gained in 21st century skills, like communication, creativity, imagination, problem solving, and collaboration,” says Thalia Goldstein, the study’s co-author and an associate professor of applied developmental psychology at George Mason University.\n\nTheater involves “active learning” — getting up on your feet to take in information, rather than merely passively absorbing it. “When you put something in your body, it’s more durable, it lasts longer, and you remember it longer,” says Kathryn Dawson, associate professor of theater at the University of Texas at Austin. And theater involves more than one “mode”: verbalizing, while making a gesture or expression, which research shows boosts brain activity.\n\nIt’s something parents, whether they realize it or not, are surrounded by. Parents of young children are familiar with pretend play — the couch is suddenly a frog castle, the floor a lake, and unbeknown to you, sharks are circling your ankles. It may seem like pure fantasy, but in fact, pretend play is the foundation for developing empathy, Goldstein says. It helps young children build emotional understanding, regulation and executive function, the foundational skills that later predict empathy levels. Parents can help foster empathy in children by introducing fiction books throughout childhood, with varied characters, settings, and authors, which correlates directly to empathy scores in adulthood. They can let them be the drivers of pretend play, authors of their own stories.\n\nAnd theater class is yet another way. It’s the social dynamic of theater, the give and take, the volley of listening and responding, that expands kids’ capacity to read cues, think quickly and creatively, work as an ensemble and see things from another perspective. Theater provides an awareness of space, pausing, waiting for somebody else to talk.\n\nFor children with autism, improv techniques increase eye attention and reciprocity of conversation, says Lisa Sherman, co-founder of Act As If, a communications program that specializes in working with autistic youths. And this is where the arts level the playing field for children of different abilities; they can participate in meaningful ways where language is not a requisite skill.\n\nA study among K-2 children in San Diego showed that participating in activities in drama and creative movement significantly improved English-speaking skills among children from primarily Spanish-speaking homes. Children with the most limited English benefited the most, says the study’s co-author, Christa Greenfader, an assistant professor of child and adolescent studies at California State University at Fullerton.\n\nDuring the 2021-2022 school year, more than 4,000 immigrant youths enrolled in public schools in Montgomery County in Maryland, the majority from Central and South America. On a recent Tuesday, Hilda Tijerina, a teaching artist, held a map before a class of 18 teenagers. This was Sharon Faber’s “Theater Class for Emergent English Learners” at Watkins Mill High School, one of 27 classrooms in nine schools where Imagination Stage, a theater arts organization, hosts workshops called “Oyeme!” (“Hear Me!”). Most of the teenagers had arrived in the United States within the year. They spoke little English and were there to express themselves. They sat stoically. “Where are we?” Faber asked the class. “Ddénde?” Tijerina translated, pointing at the map. “In Maryland!” a smattering of students answered. Then Tijerina asked the teenagers to rise from their desks and form a circle. Those who liked what she said were to walk to the center, while saying a sentence in English. “Who likes sports?” she asked. “I like sports!” most of the class called back, gathering in the middle. “Who likes high school?” she called out again. Half called back, “I like high school!” as she corrected their pronunciations.\n\nElvis, 17, arrived from El Salvador six months ago and said theater exercises helped him remember English words for days of the week, months, and numbers. For Brissya, 14, improv allowed her to practice English with classmates. She moved to the next activity, illustrating on a white page what she would do with $1 million. Beside a drawing of a shirt and pants, she wrote “buy some clothes” in English.\n\nConnecting is ultimately the goal of communication, and it is the reason the actor Alan Alda began using improv exercises with scientists. Scientists are trained to speak methodically, defend their arguments and use niche jargon, a communication style that doesn’t always land with a general audience, says Laura Lindenfeld, executive director of the Alda Center for Communicating Science.",
        "Through improv, they are taught to make mistakes and laugh about it, to “give ourselves permission to fail and move on.” “When scientists come into a room, they’re like, ‘Oh man, you’re going to put me through improv?’” she says. But after exercises like “the mirror,” looking intently into other people’s eyes, they realize they can’t succeed unless they’re in touch with the other person. Speaking becomes about making a human connection rather than pushing information — and that’s the point. You may have the most wonderful scientific finding, but if no one understands it, what’s the point? Sara Williams, mother to Charlotte, cites theater as the foundation for her daughter’s self-awareness. Charlotte began drama classes at age 5. At 13, she is not afraid to speak publicly or join the student council; she listens and has confidence. “They go to these classes and come home feeling energized, like they accomplished something,” Williams says. And not just the outgoing kids — for the shy, theater opens them up. For children with anxiety, like so many children coming out of the pandemic, “the least judgmental place you can be is in a theater class.” You can keep your individuality, and unlike in sports, you’re not competing with anyone.

        "On a warm day in April, Twila Cassadore piloted her pickup truck toward the mountains on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona to scout for wild edible plants. A wet winter and spring rains had transformed the desert into a plethora of color. Cassadore and J drove up a rough dirt road that used to be an old cattle trail, passing through various areas, moving from Sonoran desert to grasslands and pifion-juniper woodlands. In each area, Cassadore would stop to gather desert chia seeds, cacti flowers and thistles.\n\nAs a forager and celebrated food educator, Cassadore, 56, has spent the past 30 years documenting and teaching her fellow Western Apache people about the importance of wild foods in a region that’s considered one of the most biodiverse in the US — yet where diet and substance abuse are leading causes of death. Working closely with the tribe’s wellness center, the local high school and recovery groups, she often takes people out into the land to forage, cook and heal because she considers this activity to be redemptive.\n\nForaged food accounted for up to 50% of the Western Apache diet in pre-reservation times. In spring, it’s onions, potatoes, miner’s lettuce and thistles. In summer, it’s cacti fruit, berries and acorns — “the most prized food in our community,” Cassadore said. But after being forced on to reservations, the Apache were forbidden to gather their traditional foods and became dependent on rations and later, processed foods. By the time Cassadore was growing up on the 1.8m-acre reservation, she said that many people looked down on foraged food, or associated it with poverty.\n\nSo she was often teased by her elementary school classmates for bringing homemade beef jerky, acorns, pine nuts and dried mesquite pods foraged by her and her family, instead of the candy bars and sodas that everyone else had. Today the White River, San Carlos and Fort Apache reservations are considered food deserts with few grocery stores and limited access to fresh, healthy foods. “When you go to school with foraged food, you almost always got bullied,” she said. “That was traumatizing for me, and I was embarrassed to bring food from my own home. To me, eating foraged food, this was normal.” Cassadore later struggled with drug addiction and mental health issues for much of her life, but said that foraging provided her a way out. It allowed her to reconnect to her identity, culture and people, she said. She spent years learning about traditional foodways, gaining the trust of community elders, listening to their stories, and rediscovering the foods of her ancestors. This gave her purpose and “filled this void I had felt most of my life,” she said, and she is now 20 years sober.\n\nThrough her work, she now helps others struggling with addiction, depression and other mental health issues. “They come back with a connection of who they are, as an Apache person,” said Cassadore, recalling leading a traditional gloscho (desert woodrat) hunt with patients from a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. “It wakes up something inside of people. It calms them and makes them want to get better.” Naelyn Pike spent the summer after graduating high school working with Cassadore through the Traditional Western Apache Diet Project, a program to document and study traditional Ndee/Nnee (Western Apache) knowledge of the natural world and highlight the benefits of pre-reservation life and foods. Pike and other Apache youth spent days in the field with Cassadore, the project assistant, learning about Apache foods, recipes, and traditions. “It left a huge mark on my life,” said 23-year-old Pike, an Indigenous rights activist and executive assistant to the office of the chairman for the San Carlos Apache Tribe. “It teaches us the importance of our way of life as Apache people.” Like many of her peers, Pike has re-embraced foraging since her time with Cassadore, spending time each summer harvesting acorns, saguaro fruit and other wild foods. “I am very confident that when we go back to Apache foods, it doesn’t just benefit us physically, but mentally, emotionally and spiritually,” she said. “Taking part in this project has opened my eyes to understanding traditional values and how important our food is. We want to learn, preserve and grasp on to this way of life.” Tribal officials told The Guardian that people on the San Carlos Apache Reservation are facing interconnected epidemics of substance abuse, suicide and sexual violence — and the threat of ecological collapse. “For traditional people, these are all completely related,” said one tribal official who asked not to be named. “There are all kinds of historical reasons for people not living a balanced way of life. People like Twila are working really hard to bring the community back into this balance.” Cassadore is often scouting for the future. The banana yucca fruit won’t be ripe until October. However, the development of the flowers in spring will determine the plant’s fruit production. “A big patch like this is the best place to harvest,” she said of a large concentration of blooming banana yuccas whose white flowers resemble squash blossoms. She plans to return here in the fall to teach people from the community how to gather and prepare the fruit.\n\nAlong with foraging, Cassadore has interviewed more than 100 elders to help identify more than 200 wild edible plants and hundreds of traditional recipes, like acorn soup and agave pie with crust made from foraged seeds. She pulled her black Toyota truck off the side of Route 70 toward a patch of volcanic soil blanketed in small white flowers. She grabbed a screwdriver from the center console and started to dig wild vegetables from the rocky ground. “Onions,” she said. “Collect and be grateful.”",
        "Only take what you need.” She plans to eat them with dinner, along with elk and wild roasted potatoes foraged weeks earlier. “If you really want to start healing, work with the earth and ingredients that were given to us,” she said. (Adapted from The Guardian) Some members of the Western Apache community are returning to traditional food gathering methods. Some members of the Western Apache community have been able to solve many social and psychological problems through changes in diet. The recent change to traditional food gathering methods in the Western Apache community is the result of changes within American society as a whole. Children in the Western Apache community who bring foraged food to school are often envied by their classmates who have only processed foods at lunchtime. Although foraging is beneficial in many ways, it remains controversial within the Western Apache community.\n\nIn pre-reservation times, foraging was not the only food source in the Western Apache community. Native Americans suffer from a much higher rate of suicide than the general population. Some Native Americans are being healed through the practice of foraging. Foraging is promoting more individualism among some in the Western Apache community. Foraging will one day again replace mass food consumption on some reservations. Foraging is taking place solely through the efforts of some young people on reservations.",
        "The green revolution was one of the greatest feats of human ingenuity. By promoting higher yielding varieties of wheat and, especially, rice, plant-breeders in India, Mexico and the Philippines helped China emerge from a famine and India avoid one. From 1965 to 1995, Asia’s rice yields doubled and its poverty almost halved, even as its population soared.\n\nAsia’s vast rice market is a legacy of that triumph. The starchy grain is the main source of sustenance for over half the world’s population. Asians produce over 90% of rice and get more than a quarter of their calories from it. And demand for the crop is projected to soar, on the back of population growth in Asia and Africa, another big rice consumer. By one estimate, the world will need to produce almost a third more rice by 2050. Yet that looks increasingly hard — and in some ways undesirable.\n\nRice production is spluttering. Yields have increased by less than 1% a year over the past decade, much less than in the previous one. The greatest slowdowns were in South-East Asia, where Indonesia and the Philippines — together, home to 400m people — are already big importers. This has many explanations. Urbanisation and industrialisation have made labour and farmland scarcer. Excessive use of pesticides, fertiliser and irrigation have poisoned and depleted soils and groundwater. But the biggest reason may be global warming.\n\nRice is particularly susceptible to extreme conditions and is often grown in places where they are increasingly evident. Patchy monsoon rains and drought last year in India, the world’s biggest rice exporter, led to a reduced harvest and an export ban. Devastating floods in Pakistan, the fourth-biggest exporter, wiped out 15% of its rice harvest. Rising sea-levels are causing salt to seep into the Mekong Delta, Vietnam’s “rice bowl”.\n\nIt gets worse. Rice is not merely a casualty of climate change, but also a contributor to it. By starving soils of oxygen, paddy cultivation encourages methane-emitting bacteria. It is a bigger source of greenhouse gas than any foodstuff except beef. Its emissions footprint is similar to that of aviation. If you count the conversion of forestland for rice paddy — the fate of much of Madagascar’s rainforest — that footprint is even bigger.\n\nThis can create an insidious feedback loop and, in all, a far more complicated set of problems than the food insecurity that spurred the green revolution. Indeed, eating too much rice turns out to be bad for people as well as the climate. White rice is more fattening than bread or maize, and is not especially nutritious. In South Asia rice-heavy diets have been linked to high rates of diabetes and persistent malnutrition.\n\nPolicymakers need to increase rice yields, then, but more selectively than in the 1960s. In the places most suitable for rice cultivation, such as hot and sticky South-East Asia, faster adoption of new technologies, such as flood-resistant and more nutritious seeds, could provide a big productivity boost. In tandem with improved practices, such as direct seeding of paddy, they could also shorten the growing cycle and reduce the amount of water required, mitigating environmental harm. Farmers have been slow to adopt such improvements, partly because of overgenerous subsidies that shield them from the rice crisis. A better approach would make state support contingent on best practice. By encouraging crop insurance — a good idea in itself — governments could also help reassure farmers as they switch from old ways to new.\n\nGovernments need to nudge producers and consumers away from rice. India and Indonesia are promoting millet, which is more nutritious and uses a lot less water. Scrapping subsidies that favour rice over other crops would make such efforts more effective. India, for example, procures rice from farmers, often at above-market rates, then distributes it as food aid. It should make its interventions more crop-agnostic, by replacing subsidies and free rice with income support for farmers and cash transfers for the poor. That would encourage farmers to choose the best crop for their local conditions — much of India’s agricultural north-west would switch from rice to wheat overnight. Poor Indians would be free to choose a more balanced diet. Thereby, it would correct a market skewed towards environmental damage and poor health.\n\nBringing about such change in Asia and beyond will be far harder than promoting new wonder seeds. Farmers are almost everywhere a powerful constituency. Yet policymakers should get used to blending complicated economic and technological fixes in this way. Increasingly, it is what fighting climate change will demand. Sorting out the mounting crisis in the world’s most important foodstuff would be a good place to begin.",
        "Rice production should no longer be promoted because of its harmful effects on the environment and human health. Global warming has had a significant impact on rice production in Asia in recent decades. Policymakers need to implement new strategies to address the many challenges facing rice production. Despite the efforts of policymakers, producers and consumers have been slow to switch to crops other than rice. Governments need to implement policies that allow crop production to be adapted to local needs.\n\nRice is an essential food for people in Asia, so policymakers need to subsidise rice production. Providing income support to farmers and cash payments to the poor is a better policy option than subsidising rice. As much as 75% of the total population of Asia depends on rice for their daily calorie intake. Climate-related hazards are the biggest contributor to the decline of rice production in Indonesia and the Philippines. Rice production is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from foodstuff. The Indian government promotes millet because it helped India avoid a famine in the past.",
        "So what did John Nash actually do? Viewers of the Oscar-winning film “A Beautiful Mind” might come away thinking he devised a new strategy to pick up women. Mr. Nash’s contribution was far more important than the somewhat contrived analysis about whether or not to approach the most beautiful woman in the bar. What he discovered was a way to predict the outcome of virtually any kind of strategic interaction. Today, the idea of “Nash equilibrium” is a central concept in game theory.\n\nModern game theory was developed by the great mathematician John von Neumann in the mid-1940s. His goal was to understand the general logic of strategic interaction, from military battles to price wars. Von Neumann, working with the economist Oskar Morgenstern, established a general way to represent games mathematically and offered a systematic treatment of games in which the players’ interests were.\n\nGames of this sort — zero-sum games — are common in sporting events and parlor games. But most games of interest to economists are non-zero sum. When one person engages in voluntary trade with another, both are typically made better off. Although von Neumann and Morgenstern tried to analyze games of this sort, their analysis was not as satisfactory as that of the zero-sum games. Furthermore, the tools they used to analyze these two classes of games were completely different.\n\nMr. Nash came up with a much better way to look at non-zero-sum games. His method also had the advantage that it was equivalent to the von Neumann-Morgenstern analysis if the game happened to be zero sum. What Mr. Nash recognized was that in any sort of strategic interaction, the best choice for any single player depends critically on their beliefs about what the other players might do. Mr. Nash proposed that we look for outcomes in which each player is making an optimal choice, given the choices the other players are making. This is what is now known as a Nash equilibrium. At a Nash equilibrium, it is reasonable for each player to believe that all other players are playing optimally — since these beliefs are actually confirmed by the choices each player makes.\n\nIt’s a nice theory. But is it true? Does it describe actual behavior in actual games? Well, no. Game theory is: it analyzes how “fully rational” players should play if they all know they are playing against other fully rational players. That assumption of “full rationality” is the problem with game theory. In real life, most people — even economists — are not fully rational. Consider a simple example: several players are each asked to pick a number ranging from zero to 100. The player who comes closest to the number that is half the average of what everyone else says wins a prize. Before you read further, think about what number you would choose.\n\nNow consider the game theorist’s analysis. If everyone is equally rational, everyone should pick the same number. But there is only one number that is equal to half of itself — zero. This analysis is logical, but it isn’t a good description of how real people behave when they play this game: almost no one chooses zero. But it’s not as if the Nash equilibrium never works. Sometimes it works quite well. Two economists, Jacob Goeree and Charles Holt, recently published a clever article, “Ten Little Treasures of Game Theory and Ten Intuitive Contradictions,” that discusses a number of games in which the Nash theory works well, and then shows that what should be an inconsequential change to the payoffs can result in a large change in behavior.\n\nIn their simplest example, two players, whom we will call Jacob and Charles, independently and simultaneously choose an amount from 180 cents to 300 cents. Both players are paid the lower of the two amounts, and some amount R (greater than 1) is transferred from the player who chooses the larger amount to the player who chooses the smaller one. If they both pick the same number, they both are paid that amount, but no transfer is made. So if Jacob chooses 200 and Charles chooses 220, the payoff to Jacob is 200 + R and the payoff to Charles is 200 - R. If Jacob thinks Charles will say 200, then Jacob will want to announce 199. But if Charles thinks Jacob will announce 199, then Charles should say 198. And so on. The only consistent pair of beliefs is when each thinks the other will say 180.\n\nWhen Mr. Goeree and Mr. Holt performed this experiment with R = 180, nearly 80 percent of the subjects picked 180, which is the Nash prediction. When they set R = 5, and reran the experiment (with different subjects), however, the outcomes were completely reversed, with nearly 80 percent choosing 300. Findings of this sort have stimulated the development of “behavioral game theory,” which tries to formulate a theory of how to understand games involving real people, rather than those “fully rational” people.\n\nConsider, for example, the “guess half the average” game described earlier. Oscar, a simple-minded player, might think that any number between zero and 100 is equally likely, so he would guess 50. Emmy, who is more sophisticated, might figure that if lots of people were like Oscar and say 50, then she should say 25. Tony, who is yet more sophisticated, figures that if lots of people think like Emmy, then he should say 12 or 13. And so on. An economist named Rosemarie Nagel ran a game like this a few years ago and found that the choices do tend to cluster around 50, 25 and 12. In fact, the winning choice turned out to be close to 13, a number chosen by about 30 percent of the players. In this game the best strategy wasn’t the Nash equilibrium, but it wasn’t so far away from it either."

        "The Russian Tsar Peter the Great presided over an actual fashion police. His inspectors stalked the streets of St. Petersburg, shaving beards and snipping inches off coats.\n\nIf you were a bearded man in St. Petersburg around the year 1714, a token like the one pictured here would be your only defense against the overweening power of the state. It served as proof that the bearer had paid his yearly beard tax — a few kopecks for peasants, a hundred rubles or more for nobles or military officials.\n\nThe beard tax was just one part of a larger project: Peter the Great’s aesthetic reinvention of Russian culture. The Tsar ordered his subjects to replace their familiar long Russian overcoats with French or Hungarian jackets. Mannequins set outside the Moscow city gates illustrated the new fashions for all to see. Tailors who continued to sell Russian styles ran the risk of steep fines, and anyone walking the streets in an old-fashioned robe was liable to have it cut short by the Tsar's inspectors.\n\nThe project had its roots in Tsar Peter’s days travelling around Europe. In 1697, when he set out on a grand tour, Peter chose to travel in disguise, adopting the name “Sergeant Pyotr Mikhaylov.” Excited rumors of his visit spread from town to town, heralding him as a giant: seven feet tall, brilliant, and only half-civilized. The trip would consume the next two years. For a time, he worked at a Dutch shipyard to learn ship-building techniques. He visited heads of state, collections of natural curiosities, and anatomical theaters, and threw legendarily wild parties. One particularly raucous event left every one of his host’s chairs smashed into pieces, his paintings shredded into ribbons, and chunks of pavement torn out of the ground.\n\nUpon returning from his travels, Peter launched immediately into the process of “Europeanizing” his homeland. The first of the Tsar’s new enthusiasm were the beards of his court nobles, shaved at his welcome-home party. As biographer Robert K. Massie writes, “After passing among his [friends and embracing them...he began shaving off their beards” with his own hands. He doubled down at his New Year’s banquet, at which his razor-wielding court jester worked the crowd, slapping the side of the head of anyone who seemed reluctant to shave.\n\nAccording to Captain John Perry, an English visitor to Russia, the Russians submitted only upon “the terror of having [their beards] ...pulled out by the roots, or sometimes taken so rough off, that some of the skin went with them.” He goes on to tell the story of a Russian carpenter who was obliged by the Tsar’s decree to lose his beard: I jested a little with him on this occasion, telling him that he had become a young man, and asked him what he had done with his beard. Upon which he put his hand in his bosom and pulled it out, and showed it to me; also telling me, that upon returning home, he would carefully keep it to have it put in his coffin and buried along with him, that he might be able to give an account of it to Saint Nicholas in the afterlife: and that all his fellow workmen who had been shaved that day had taken the same care.\n\nIn this, the carpenter was guided by the teachings of the Russian Orthodox Church, which considered uncut facial hair a reflection of piety. Man was created in the image of God; that included the beard. To shave it was a grave sin.\n\nTo the pious, the beard tax was a shocking scandal. Rumors circulated that Peter was not the real Tsar but a replacement installed by Russia’s enemies. Anonymous letters accusing the Tsar of blasphemy were scattered on the city streets. Nevertheless, the shavings continued. Finally, in 1705, a Russian military division initiated an open revolt in the town of Astrakhan. A letter from the rebels proclaimed that they were for Christianity and against shaving and foreign dress. The revolt was crushed, and hundreds of rebels lost their lives.\n\nThe beard tax was just one way that the Tsar sparred with the Church. With typical flair, Peter organized his drinking companions into a club known as the “All-Jesling and All-Drunken Religious Assembly of Fools and Jesters.” The members played at being cardinals and bishops and performed mock marriages and religious ceremonies. They engaged in constant merriment, compulsory drunkenness, and endless feasts and masquerades. There was no escape from the All-Drunken Assembly; appointments were for life. In this way, blasphemy served as a test of loyalty for the Tsar's closest companions. The implicit choice was clear.\n\nAs the historian V. M. Zhivov writes in “Cultural Reforms in Peter the Great's System of Transformations,” by challenging the Church's power, the Tsar sought to frame himself as a semi-divine figure, outside of the bounds of normal society:\n\nThe Tsar demonstrated that he commanded divine power, and society had the choice of either accepting this inhuman superiority or rejecting it as a satanic enterprise. In any case this posed for society. The Tsar rose above reality and, wielding the power of life and death, transformed that reality according to his desire, turning age-old customs into blasphemous entertainments.",
        "playful inventions into state institutions. Like the beard tax itself, the conflict seems absurd: a few drunken nobles playing pretend priests. But the struggle — one over the very nature of royal power — was deadly serious.\n\nWe stood up for the Christian faith and against shaving and German dress and tobacco and because we and our wives and children were not admitted into God’s church in old Russian dress. And those who went to church, of both male and female sexes, had their garments chopped up and were pushed out of God’s churches and sent packing. “Show and tell” was a method that Peter frequently employed to ensure that the public would not excuse themselves by pleading ignorance of his policies.",
        "In 1708 an informer reported that, when the Tsar was in Moscow, everyone wore German dress but in his absence the wives of some of the Tsar’s leading officials wore old-fashioned gowns to church, even though they put skirts over them, cursing the sovereign’s decree. One can infer that the skirts worn by the wives were meant as protest.\n\nHere “liable” means held legally responsible.\n\nHere “doubled down” means committed even further.\n\nHere “piety” means devotion.\n\nHere “compulsory” means mandatory.",
        "In contrast to their generally similar levels of performance on standardized tests, American boys and girls perform very differently when measured by grades in their courses in school. Because performance in courses is less standardized, there is less consensus on gender differences in this measure of academic performance. Nonetheless, evidence indicates that girls have outperformed boys academically since the turn of the twentieth century. In the middle of the nineteenth century, girls enrolled in coeducational schools at roughly the same rate as boys, and for the most part, girls in those schools took the same classes with the same teachers as their male counterparts. Even then, girls earned higher grades than boys and were promoted to the next year level more readily. Writing in 1910, J. E. Armstrong reported that “the first three primary year levels of the schools of the whole United States show that a larger number of boys than girls have to repeat their year levels; the census shows that the sexes are born in very nearly equal numbers and yet the boys are four percent more numerous in the first grade.” It is also striking that as early as 1870, when rates of high school completion were extremely low (only two percent of seventeen-year-olds completed high school at the time), more girls than boys completed high school.\n\nRegardless of their better performance in elementary school and higher rates of high school completion, young women were barred from attending college for much of the nineteenth century. They were first allowed to enroll in college in 1837, when Oberlin College began admitting women, arguably to provide ministers of religion with intelligent, cultivated, and thoroughly schooled wives. When the Civil War led to a shortage of male students, more colleges became willing to enroll tuition-paying female students. By 1900, more than twice as many women were enrolled in coeducational institutions as were enrolled in women’s colleges. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the rapid rise in the number of women enrolling in coeducational institutions precipitated a new fear that women would take over colleges.\n\nFast-forward to the current era, and the female advantage in academic performance at all levels of education is indisputable. As early as kindergarten, girls demonstrate more advanced reading skills than boys, and boys continue to have problems with reading in elementary school. From kindergarten through high school and into college, girls get better grades than boys in all major subjects, including math and science. This leads us to ask if school-based policies can help improve the educational performance of boys. Boys face particular challenges stemming from the dual nature of masculine identity during adolescence. In schools with cultures that treat academic success as compatible with a respectable status within the adolescent culture, boys are more likely to perform on a par with girls. In other words, we expect the male shortfall to be relatively small in high-quality schools.\n\nThree promising arenas of school policy intervention have the potential to improve student outcomes: teachers, student culture, and instructional and evaluation techniques. Firstly, a growing literature suggests that teacher quality affects academic performance, and some recent reports suggest that good teachers have long-lasting effects on their students. Scholars also increasingly recognize that, along with cognitive skills, social and behavioral skills affect academic achievement and later success in the labor market, and that teachers differ in their ability to promote these skills. Beyond teachers, other support staff such as guidance counselors may play an important role in students’ educational outcomes. The second promising arena of policy change, student culture and peer effects, has been a focus since the early 1960s. Finally, instructional effects are the most difficult of the three school policy interventions to study, partly because instructional curricula are not readily quantifiable. Considerable research suggests that small class sizes are better than large ones, that putting students into college preparation tracks is generally detrimental to poorly performing students, and that tough academic standards do not boost academic achievement for poorly performing students. These policy areas clearly overlap with each other; for example, teachers can contribute to student climate, better instructional techniques may improve teacher quality, and academically oriented student cultures may improve both the effectiveness of some teachers and the impact of some instructional techniques.\n\nAttachment to school is an equally powerful motivator for educational performance. Despite common perceptions, students do not generally disparage academic achievement, so long as it is accompanied by other desirable behaviors like being popular, dressing stylishly, being athletic, and otherwise participating in extracurricular activities. John Bishop and his colleagues report that 81 percent of middle and high school students who were surveyed disagreed with the statement that “it’s not cool to frequently volunteer answers or comments in class,” 85 percent disagreed with the statement that “it’s not cool to study real hard for tests and quizzes,” and 73 percent disagreed with the statement that “it’s not cool to be enthusiastic about what you are learning in school.” Apparently students begin to cross the “not cool” line when they exhibit overt competitiveness about grades, but students generally appreciate that high levels of educational achievement are valuable in today’s world.\n\nAt the same time, it is also clear from the data that girls express stronger allegiance to educational values than boys. Eighth-grade students were asked how important grades were to them and how.",
        "important they perceived grades to be to their parents. Almost 99 percent of the students reported that good grades are “very important” to their parents, with essentially no variations in these proportions by gender, parental education, or parents’ educational expectations for their child. Girls expressed a valuation that was closer to what they attributed to their parents than was the case for boys, showing that boys place greater distance between their values and the values they attribute to their parents than do girls.\n\nNow that a female advantage in educational achievement has emerged, it is natural to ask whether and how schools affect gender inequality. We need to consider whether school policies that help one gender also help the other, or whether the interests of boys and girls are incompatible, such that policies designed to help boys compete with those designed to help girls.",
        "E training high quality teachers who can promote social and behavioral skills. According to the study by John Bishop and his colleagues on middle and high school students, about half think that being overtly competitive is acceptable. Around three-quarters think it is okay to enjoy what they are studying. Most see the value of educational achievement. Over four-fifths think it is not cool to volunteer answers in class. The vast majority believe it is acceptable to study hard for tests.\n\nThe police officer warned the mayor, “You do not want to give us reason to arrest you. You will be charged with interfering with an officer of the law if you continue to obstruct this investigation. Your son has been caught selling information of a sensitive nature that he stole from his workplace then trying to run away. We are not at liberty to share any details beyond this, as it could compromise the case. Now, please stand aside.” Baby seals need solid ice to survive, but a warming world and shortage of stable ice in recent years have led to a raise in their deaths. Because of their different chemistry, some types of plastic are very easy to recycle, whereas until something changes, landfill is the only destination for others. The scientists found that human volunteers could correctly guess the meaning of each gesture made by apes over 50% of the time.

        "The lawsuit began like so many others: a man named Roberto Mata sued the airline Avianca, saying he was injured when a metal serving cart struck his knee during a flight to New York City.\n\nAvianca asked a Manhattan federal judge to dismiss the case, Mr. Mata’s lawyers strongly objected, submitting a ten-page brief that cited multiple relevant court decisions. There was Martinez v. Delta Air Lines, Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines, and Varghese v. China Southern Airlines, its detailed discussion of complex federal law.\n\nThere was one hitch: no one — not the airline’s lawyers, not even the judge himself — could find the decisions or the quotations cited and summarized in the brief.\n\nThat was because ChatGPT had invented everything.\n\nThe lawyer who created the brief, Steven A. Schwartz, threw himself at the court, confessing that he had used the AI program to do his legal research — “a source that has revealed itself to be unreliable.”"

        "Fred stops by his colleague Alice’s office to make a request.\n\nAlice: Hi. Fred. What's up? Fred: Hi. Alice. I'm hoping you can help me out with something. I inadvertently scheduled meetings with two companies at the same time.\n\nAlice: How did that happen? Fred: Well, from my point of view, it’s not completely my fault. QRS Company emailed me several weeks ago, asking for some potential dates we could meet this month. I contacted them immediately with some possibilities but then RightSmart contacted me.\n\nAlice: Let me guess. The minute you made the other appointment, they contacted you asking for the exact same time slot, right? Fred: I just set up a meeting with RightSmart, and I'd feel like an idiot immediately asking them to reschedule it.\n\nAlice: But can’t you just tell QRS that? Fred: Well, I could, but the meeting would be really beneficial for our side, and I'm afraid if I back out, they may simply give up on the idea of meeting.\n\nAlice: That’s a valid concern. But do you really think it is a good business relationship to be at their beck and call? Fred: I shouldn’t have asked you. I'll figure it out on my own.\n\nAlice: Hang on. I'll help you, of course, provided I’m free. I wasn’t trying to give you a hard time. I just wanted to encourage you not to bend over backwards for this opportunity. Tell me what I can do.\n\nFred: Well, the date in question is March 8, at 10:00 a.m. I'd like to take the meeting with QRS, so I was wondering if you could step in for me in the meeting with RightSmart. I know you’ve had some dealings with them before.\n\nAlice: Hold on. Let me check my schedule. Yeah, it should be fine. I have another commitment from 11:30 but it'll be over by then, right? Fred: Oh, sure. The RightSmart meeting should take 45 minutes tops. Basically, it’s a courtesy call. They've got a couple of new employees they'd like to introduce to us.\n\nAlice: OK, then. Why don’t you email them to let them know I'll be handling the meeting and cc me on it? Fred: Thanks, Alice. You’ve saved me from some embarrassment.",
        "Twenty-five years ago, on Dec. 3, 1997, the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, gave a talk at the W3C meeting in London. His speech was notable for its review of the early web, its initial development, and his thoughts about the future of the web.\n\nOne idea Berners-Lee posited in his talk — an idea he had been thinking about for more than a year — was undeniably brilliant. He suggested that every browser be equipped with what he called the “Oh, Yeah?” button. The idea was that we all would start building trust through signed metadata as we moved around the web. In a sense, our normal web browsing would create a gigantic accumulation of crowd-sourced credibility. “When we have this, we will be able to ask the computer not just for information, but why we should believe it,” he said.\n\nImagine an “Oh, yeah?” button on your browser. There you are looking at a fantastic deal that can be yours just for the entry of a credit card number and the click of a button. “Oh, yeah?” you think. You press the “Oh, yeah?” button. You are asking your browser why you should believe it. It, in turn, can challenge the server to provide some credentials: perhaps, a signature for the document or a list of documents. Those documents will be signed. Your browser rummages through with the server, looking for a way to convince you that the page is trustworthy for a purchase. Maybe it will come up with an endorsement from a magazine, which in turn has been endorsed by a friend. Maybe it will come up with an endorsement by the seller’s bank, which has in turn an endorsement from your bank. Maybe it won't find any reason for you to actually believe what you are reading at all.\n\nThe “Oh, Yeah?” button, it should be noted, was not truly about verifying information or locating “truth.” Berners-Lee wasn’t suggesting that ontological certitude would arise from the web mob’s ranking of websites that distributed the most accurate information. Rather, the “Oh, Yeah?” button would suggest a more paradigmatic truth — that is, what was considered generally in the realm of credible by most people.\n\nThe “Oh, Yeah?” button represented an early warning that we'd all need to be more skeptical in cyberspace in the future. It was also an admission that the web, in the future, would likely be employed to fool us with some regularity. Politicians, salespeople, criminals, miscreants, and liars would abound, and we'd need an easy way to counter them in our daily perusal of information.\n\nHad it come to pass, so many ills that plague the web and social media today — think: “fake news” accusations, disinformation campaigns, and catfishing — could have been addressed from the start.\n\nYet, ultimately, the “Oh, Yeah?” button never got installed on our browsers. Too many factors conspired against it. In Berners-Lee’s original example, he noted its direct challenge to advertising. As the web grew more and more commercial, the idea that a simple click of a button might reveal paradigmatic truth about any product’s advertised claims represented an almost existential threat to its usefulness as a selling vehicle. The “Oh, Yeah?” button might also have resulted in increased tension and argumentation as the web evolved toward social media. Imagine the anger that would be ignited if you let your crazy uncle know what your browser’s “Oh, Yeah?” button informed you about his latest Facebook conspiracy.\n\nThe “Oh, Yeah?” button, for all its admirable skepticism, also contained an important flaw that would only be revealed in the algorithmic age. Because each of our browsers would independently accumulate the signed metadata based on our distinct web usage, each of our “Oh, Yeah?” buttons would present us with distinct, unique paradigmatic truths. Just as no two social media feeds are completely identical, it’s likely no two “Oh, Yeah?” buttons would return identical findings. Berners-Lee, back in 1997, was too optimistic about the possibility of accumulating and distributing a shared reality in the future. We know now that we prefer social media algorithms, channeling us into worlds where our biases and beliefs require no skepticism. Why would anybody want to click an “Oh, Yeah?” button to check the hilarious political meme reconfirming exactly what they already know to be true? Why spoil the fun?\n\nIn hindsight, we ultimately traded away the “Oh, Yeah?” button for the “Like” button. And that was a huge mistake.",

        "Owning or operating a superyacht is probably the most harmful thing an individual can do to the climate. If we're serious about avoiding climate chaos, we need to tax, or at the very least shame, these resource-hoarding behemoths out of existence. In fact, taking on the carbon aristocracy, and their most emissions-intensive modes of travel and leisure, may be the best chance we have to boost our collective “climate morale” and increase our appetite for personal sacrifice — from individual behavior changes to sweeping policy mandates.\n\nOn an individual basis, the superrich pollute far more than the rest of us, and travel is one of the biggest parts of that. Take, for instance, Rising Sun, the 454-foot, 82-room megaship owned by the DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen. According to a 2021 analysis in the journal Sustainability, the diesel fuel powering Mr. Geffen’s boating habit spews an estimated 16,320 tons of carbon-dioxide-equivalent gases into the atmosphere annually, almost 800 times what the average American generates in a year.\n\nAnd that’s just a single ship. Worldwide, more than 5,500 private vessels clock in about 100 feet or longer, the size at which a yacht becomes a superyacht. This fleet pollutes as much as entire nations: The 300 biggest boats alone emit 315,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year, based on their likely emissions — about as much as Burundi’s more than 10 million inhabitants.\n\nThen there are the private jets, which make up a much higher overall contribution to climate change. Private aviation added 37 million tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere in 2016, which rivals the annual emissions of Hong Kong or Ireland. Private plane use has increased since then, so today’s number is likely higher.\n\nYou’re probably thinking: But isn’t that a drop in the bucket compared to the thousands of coal plants around the world spewing carbon? It’s a common sentiment; last year, Christophe Béchu, France's minister of the environment, dismissed calls to regulate yachts and chartered flights as “le buzz” — flashy, populist solutions that get people amped up but ultimately only fiddle at the margins of climate change.\n\nBut this misses a much more important point. Research in economics and psychology suggests humans are willing to behave altruistically — but only when they believe everyone is being asked to contribute. People “stop cooperating when they see that some are not doing their part,” as the cognitive scientists Nicolas Baumard and Coralie Chevallier wrote last year.\n\nIn that sense, superpolluting yachts and jets don’t just worsen climate change; they lessen the chance that we will work together to fix it. Why bother, when the luxury goods mogul Bernard Arnault is cruising around on the Symphony, a $150 million, 333-foot superyacht? “If some people are allowed to emit 10 times as much carbon for their comfort,” Mr. Baumard and Ms. Chevallier asked, “then why restrict your meat consumption, turn down your thermostat or limit your purchases of new products?” Whether we’re talking about voluntary changes (insulating our attics and taking public transit) or mandated ones (tolerating a wind farm on the horizon or saying goodbye to a lush lawn), the climate fight hinges to some extent on our willingness to participate. When the ultrarich are given a free pass, we lose faith in the value of that sacrifice.\n\nTaxes aimed at superyachts and private jets would take some of the sting out of these conversations, helping to improve everybody’s “climate morale,” a term coined by Georgetown Law professor Brian Galle. But it isn’t likely to change the behavior of the billionaires who buy them. Instead, we can impose new social costs through good, old-fashioned shaming.\n\nLast June, @CelebJets — a Twitter account that tracked the flights of well-known figures using public data, then calculated their carbon emissions for all to see — revealed that the influencer Kylie Jenner took a 17-minute flight between two regional airports in California. “Kylie Jenner is out here taking 3-minute flights with her private jet, but I’m the one who has to use paper straws,” one Twitter user wrote.\n\nThere’s a lesson here: Massively disproportionate per capita emissions get people angry. And they should. When billionaires squander our shared supply of resources on ridiculous boats or cushy chartered flights, it shortens the span of time available for the rest of us before the effects of warming become truly devastating. In this way, superyachts and private planes start to look less like extravagance and more like theft.\n\nChange can happen — and quickly. French officials are exploring curbing private plane travel. And just last week — after sustained pressure from activists — Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam announced it would ban private jets as a climate-saving measure.\n\nEven in the United States, carbon shaming can have outsized impact. Richard Aboulafia, who’s been an aviation industry consultant and analyst for 35 years, says that cleaner, greener aviation, from all-electric city hoppers to a new class of sustainable fuels, is already on the horizon for short flights. Private aviation’s high-net-worth customers just need more incentive to adopt these new technologies. Ultimately, he says, it’s only our vigilance and pressure that will speed these changes along.\n\nThere’s a similar opportunity with superyachts. Just look at Koru, Jeff Bezos’s newly built 416-foot superyacht.",
        "megaship, a three-masted schooner that can reportedly cross the Atlantic on wind power alone. It’s a start. Even small victories challenge the standard narrative around climate change. We can say no to the idea of limitless plunder, of unjustifiable overconsumption. We can say no to the billionaires’ toys.\n\nThe French minister of the environment claimed that controlling the use of private yachts and jets would be a controversial solution inviting vigorous opposition from people. By saying “I'm the one who has to use paper straws,” the Twitter user implies that people on private jets are not doing their share to protect the environment. Which of the following can be considered a central message of the article? A sense of unfairness discourages ordinary people from their active participation in activities to improve the environment.",
        "Artificial intelligence (AI) is nothing new. It’s been around since the 1950s, but 2023 certainly feels like a tipping point. No longer is AI the sole provenance of academics and tech professionals. With the introduction of ChatGPT, Google Bard and the like, the technology is now easily accessible to all. And therein lies the challenge.\n\nAs AI becomes ever more consumable and its capabilities continue to evolve at breakneck speed, so too will the implications for society as a whole. In an ideal world, government, industry and civil society should work together to ensure that AI is developed and implemented ethically. But the genie is out of the bottle, so to speak, and despite growing concern from AI pioneers and thought leaders alike, there's likely no slowing it down.\n\nThere’s plenty that we can do to set up some guardrails around sticky ethical considerations. It begins with recognizing bias and minimizing manipulation by increasing transparency and opening a dialogue about the ethical challenges that AI presents.\n\nOne of the key concerns surrounding the ethics of AI is the potential for reinforcing existing biases. Bias in AI systems can have far-reaching consequences. When biased data is fed into AI models, it can perpetuate biases on an unprecedented scale.\n\nIt all begins with the concept of “data in, data out.” If biased data is used to train AI models, the resulting outputs will inevitably reflect those biases. Machine learning algorithms have the power to amplify these biases, and unless we actively check for and address them, we risk perpetuating societal inequalities unintentionally.\n\nThis issue becomes especially significant when AI is employed in decision-making processes, such as hiring, lending or criminal justice. Addressing bias in AI is crucial to ensure fairness and equity in all of its applications.\n\nAnother area of concern is the use of AI to manipulate people's behavior. We all know how annoying it is when Alexa or Siri picks up on our conversations and serves up targeted ads accordingly. You talk about needing a new bathing suit for an upcoming vacation to Hawaii, and the next thing you know, you're inundated with swimsuit ads. With the integration of AI, the potential for behavior manipulation grows exponentially.\n\nImagine a future where AI can understand our sentiment or tone of voice even when we don’t explicitly, or directly, express our opinions. AI will be able to use these subtle intonations to make assumptions and predictions about our behaviors, opinions and ideas. This opens the door for potential manipulation that could be used in everything from targeted ads all the way to political persuasion.\n\nSo what's an organization to do? All AI systems should be designed so that they can be audited and reviewed. Organizations should check for biases within the data used to train AI models. A steering committee, or “model committee,” can be set up to look at models, scrutinize the rules that support them and analyze their behavior to identify and remove any built-in biases. “It can go all the way from the top down to a process level improvement,” says Michelle Yi, “and there are a lot of ways that organizations can focus on helping to address this issue.” Organizations must also prioritize transparency and accountability by making their policies around AI clear to both employees and the public. It may help to create a vision statement about how the organization will leverage AI, including the company’s stance — and ethics — around it, and how AI maps back to the company’s mission statement. Bottom line, the objectives and approach of how an organization uses AI must be clear to consumers, stakeholders and shareholders alike.\n\nIndustry leaders should also work with the government to establish clear rules and regulations that foster innovation while ensuring accountability and transparency. Cooperation between government, industry and civil society will be crucial in order to harness the power of AI for good and avoid the pitfalls of what could go wrong.\n\nThe ethics of AI will impact everyone — not just people in the business world. As human beings and consumers, technology's influence is inescapable, like it or not. This is why it’s so important to have the conversation now, in the early phases of what AI is potentially going to grow into.\n\nOn an individual level, we must all become more discerning consumers and question the information that’s fed to us. Awareness is the first step toward mitigating the impact of manipulation. By being critical of sources and not taking information at face value, we can better protect ourselves.\n\nAddressing the ethical challenges AI presents now is the best way to ensure that the technology reaches its potential to benefit society. Putting steps in place to remove bias and being aware of manipulation is the first step. We must start the conversations now in order to build a framework that safeguards society's values and fosters responsible and beneficial AI implementation.",
        "Since there is always a possibility of biased information being input into the AI model, it is important to inspect the system regularly. Siri’s picking up our conversations to bombard us with relevant advertisements is an example of behavioral manipulation. The problems that bias in AI poses for society could include issues such as employing new staff and assessing applications for loans.\n\nA crucial issue is being reexamined. An important secret has been disclosed prematurely. An irreversible event has occurred. An obvious problem is being avoided. Accepting information as is without challenging it, agreeing to the information to save face, interpreting information in a way that is most beneficial, taking in only the information that is valuable and useful.\n\nAs a result, even so, far from that, for example, for starters, rather, subsequently.\n\nWhich of the following issues does the author NOT mention as an existing or potential problem with AI? Manipulation of the public by political actors, misinformation resulting in online fraud, reproducing and exacerbating human bias, unwanted and tiresome advertising.\n\nHow can organizations be more transparent regarding their use of AI? By clarifying the ways in which AI will be employed, by creating a mandatory mission statement, by defining discrete policies to their customers and shareholders, by training employees about implicit bias.\n\nWhich of the following is advocated by the article? Boosting collaboration between the private and public sectors, finding ways to stop AI from reading our feelings, promoting the use of AI in key decision-making processes, restricting the data used to train AI models to those approved by the government.",
        "Our experience shows that leaders’ success depends on their ability to MOVE — that is, to be mindfully alert to priorities, to generate options so that they always have several ways to win, to validate their own vantage point, and to engage with stakeholders to ensure that they are along for the ride. In this article, we examine the crucial second step of our model. Specifically, we look at four common leadership approaches and the scenarios in which each can be most helpful, and we introduce a process for navigating the options in real time.\n\nDozens of research studies spearheaded by American psychologists Charles “Rick” Snyder and Shane J. Lopez demonstrate how people’s capacity to reach their desired goals can be increased by conceiving multiple possible pathways. Most people assume that success in a task is a question of perseverance or willpower. But Snyder and Lopez show that willpower must include “way power” to drive successful outcomes. Their research suggests that ideally you will have four or more options or pathways for achieving your goals (external priorities). It also demonstrates the importance of determining who you want to be as a leader in terms of your character strengths and values (internal priorities) and how you can best relate to others (interpersonal priorities).\n\nBuilding on this work, we have developed an approach, called the “four stances,” to help leaders generate options for interpersonal communication. Think how tennis players nearly instantly shift their stance to make an optimal response to a ball hurtling over the net. The core concept for our approach is rooted in evolutionary psychology and how our basic reflexes (fight, flight, and so on) automatically deploy under dangerous or novel circumstances. In the more evolved world of leadership, the four stances help leaders identify and access more interpersonal options. The stances are: — Lean In. Take an active stance on resolving an issue. Actions in this stance include deciding, directing, guiding, challenging, and confronting. — Lean Back. Take an analytical stance to observe, collect, and understand data. Actions include analyzing, asking questions, and possibly delaying decisions. — Lean With. Take a collaborative stance, focusing on caring and connecting. Actions include empathizing, encouraging, and coaching. — Don’t Lean. Whereas a Lean Back posture involves observing and analyzing, Don’t Lean is about being still and disciplining yourself to create space for a new solution to bubble up from your subconscious. This stance also serves to calm you if your emotions have been triggered. Actions include contemplating, visualizing, and settling through diaphragmatic breathing.\n\nTo win in any leadership moment, great leaders need to develop and be able to access all four stances. To illustrate, let’s consider one of our clients, Isobel, a newly appointed president of a major business line at a tech company.\n\nIsobel was in trouble and called us in. She was at loggerheads with the firm’s mercurial CEO, who had a tendency to be unreliable — contradicting himself, changing positions, and often making promises the company couldn’t deliver. “I’m getting a bad reputation for being aggressive at board meetings,” she told us at our first two-on-one coaching session. “I just tell the truth — someone needs to — but I’m the one getting dinged.” As we talked, we identified a clear gap between her own and others’ perceptions. Leaning In was her default stance. As a former lawyer, she was a world-class debater, and her impact was far more powerful than she realized. It was clear she needed to overcome her reflexive behavior and find other ways to win. We described the four stances and asked her to consider alternatives to her default approach. “But I need to be assertive,” she countered. “Of course,” we responded, “but you can use other stances while still being true to yourself.” We went through the stances one by one. In situations in which Lean In was the best choice, she saw that she could be more skillful by better calibrating the intensity of her remarks. If she could learn to Lean Back and not rush into conflict, she could slow down her reactions and be more strategic about when she would engage. If she applied Don’t Lean, she could take a moment to breathe, which could help her neutralize her activation by the CEO and keep a clear head. We were all surprised that asking about Lean With was what pivoted Isobel into a new way of operating. Drawing on Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson’s groundbreaking work on psychological safety, we asked, “What if your job at the board meeting was to make the CEO and directors feel safe?” Isobel immediately embraced that approach, which appealed to her protective side. She spontaneously started thinking through the implications. Supporting the CEO would probably help him calm down and make the meetings less painful for everyone. In the Lean With stance, she could also tolerate his contradictions by understanding that his first reaction wasn’t always his final decision. She decided that she would enthusiastically support his comments when they were in alignment with the executive committee’s assessment and refrain from reflexively challenging him when he veered off course, unless the board was close to a vote on that recommendation. After adopting this approach, her reputation with the board skyrocketed. She became known as a leader who made peace rather than war.",
        "According to the article, which of the following is true of the four stances? They are essentially modern equivalents of “fight or flight.” They need to be used sparingly and with caution. They offer four approaches to interpersonal engagement. They often work in tandem with each other in real time.\n\nWhich of the following most accurately explains the underlined ‘A!? a deeply ingrained introverted tendency a highly emotional state of mind an exceedingly permissive behavior an overly assertive approach Which of the following best paraphrases the underlined !B-? her desire to prevent the CEO from aggravating the situation her fear of confronting the CEO her impulsive behavior triggered by the CEO her misconceptions toward the CEO Why did Lean With work best for Isobel? It was consistent with the caring aspect of her personality. Lean With was a forward approach similar to her default stance. Resolving the CEO’s contradictions impressed the board. The CEO was too aggressive to appreciate other approaches."

        "Most salamanders live in streams and under rocks or logs, but the wandering salamander (Aneides vagrans) has a high-flying lifestyle. These 13-centimeter-long amphibians spend much or all of their lives in coastal redwoods, some of the tallest trees in the world. Now, a laboratory study shows how they can descend by jumping, slowing their fall by spreading their limbs like a skydiver.\n\nTo study the aerial ability of the wandering salamander, researchers brought several individuals into the lab along with three other species that vary in how well they climb. They put them into a wind tunnel with a fan blowing upward to simulate the animal falling. Both the wandering salamander and its relative, the arborcal salamander (A. lugubris), often spread their limbs like a skydiver in freefall, maximizing drag. This slowed their descent by as much as 10%, the researchers report today in Current Biology. Other times, the salamanders glided and turned in various directions by wiggling their legs and tail. In contrast, the speckled black salamander (A. flavipunctatus), which isn’t known for its climbing ability, and the ground-dwelling Monterey ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii), at best sometimes managed to glide but without much control.\n\nSkydiving could be an effective way to avoid predators. It might also be a more efficient way of moving down the tree. The researchers are now studying the flight behavior with computer models to figure out how wandering salamanders — which have no obvious adaptations for flight, such as flaps of skin — generate lift to help them glide.\n\nScientists have observed that babies and toddlers show a strong preference for sweet tastes. This preference was once an evolutionary advantage. Sugar from fruit or honey was a quick source of complex carbohydrates. And fruit that was sweet and ripe gave a person more nutritional value.\n\nThe preference for sweet foods diminishes in late adolescence. And older teens and people in their early twenties discover they no longer care for sugary bubblegum or sweet strawberry drops. As we age, however, we become less reliant on a food item’s taste profile. Our memory and perception enable us to try, and even like, new food items. “As we grow and get exposed to different flavors, there is a lot of learning going on. We associate different tastes with different consequences,” says Nancy E. Rawson with the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. A person, for example, might learn that bitter tastes aren’t harmful and that Brussels sprouts are indeed delightful when tossed with a bacon dressing. This can prompt a person to try more bitter tastes. Conversely, feeling ill after devouring a grease-blotted taquito can prompt a person to avoid such foods in the future. This evolving palate, Rawson says, allows a person to adapt to environmental changes, in which certain foods might be unavailable or new foods are introduced. “Our senses are remarkable. They are constantly changing throughout our life,” Rawson says. “This allows the system to react to the environment so it can stimulate the right kind of behavior.” Similar to how our skin cells replenish less robustly as we age, Rawson says our taste cells also diminish as we age. For women, taste cells begin atrophying and reducing in number after age forty. For men, the change starts in their fifties. The sense of smell also dwindles as a person ages. Much of a flavor’s sensation comes from the aroma, and losing this sense can diminish a person’s pleasure. These changes, however, are gradual and not significant. Rawson says a person can adapt and enjoy tasting food and eating throughout their older years. The problem is when certain medications interrupt taste cells.",
        "A water and electric utility in central California will install a first-of-its-kind network of solar panels on water canals. Turlock Irrigation District (TID) has secured a $20 million grant from the state to pursue the first-in-the-nation project, which could serve a beneficial double whammy: create renewable energy and save some water in the process.\n\nA lot of water in California wends its way through the state’s 4,000 miles of open delivery canals that comprise the aqueduct system, transporting water supply from the Sierra Nevada mountains and northern parts of the state to reservoirs, lakes, hydropower plants, and farms. The water supply in the state is already under serious dual threats from overuse and climate change, so every drop counts. And these exposed canals have a serious flaw: They allow some of that precious water to evaporate.\n\nCovering all the canals in the state with solar panels, last year’s analysis found, could save 63 billion gallons of water annually — about the amount needed to irrigate 50,000 acres of farmland or to supply 2 million people with their water needs. Those panels, the study’s authors calculated, could supply 13 gigawatts of solar energy, about a sixth of the state’s total energy needs. The water's cooling effect, in turn, could help keep those solar panels working more effectively, since solar panels lose some efficiency on very hot days.\n\nFiguring out how to maximize space around and under solar arrays is nothing new. There's a growing practice known as agrivoltaics that seeks to elevate solar panels on farmland to allow agricultural activity to still occur, while floating solar panels have been deployed in places like Japan and Singapore. But constructing solar panels as a protection measure for irrigation canals is a new idea. It won't fix the West’s serious water use problems or the mounting threat climate change poses to water supply, but it does represent the kind of creative solution California needs to explore as it stares down a water-scarce future. “A lot of water gets evaporated just because we don't put a lid on it,” Brandi McKuin, the paper’s lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at University of California, Santa Cruz, told Gizmodo last year.\n\nChanging what you eat could add up to 13 years to your life, according to a newly published study, especially if you start when you are young. The study created a model of what might happen to a man or woman’s longevity if they replaced a “typical Western diet” focused on red meat and processed foods with an “optimized diet” focused on eating less red and processed meat and more fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts.\n\nIf a woman began eating optimally at age 20, she could increase her lifespan by just over 10 years, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine. A man eating the healthier diet from age 20 could add 13 years to his life. Focusing on a healthier diet could also lengthen the lives of older adults, the study said. By starting at age 60, a woman could still increase her lifespan by eight years. Men starting a healthier diet at age 60 might add nearly nine years to their lives. A plant-based eating style could even benefit 80-year-olds, the study said: Men and women could gain about 3.5 years of extra life from dietary changes. “The notion that improving diet quality would reduce the risk of chronic disease and premature death is long established, and it only stands to reason that less chronic disease and premature death means more life expectancy,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\nKatz, the president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. “What they define as an ‘optimal’ diet is not quite optimal; it’s just a whole lot better than ‘typical,’” Katz said, adding that he felt the diet could be “further improved, conferring even greater benefits. My impression is that their ‘much improved’ diet still allowed for considerable doses of meat and dairy,” Katz said.",
        "Focus on plant-based foods over meat and processed foods. Increase plant-based foods, decrease meat and processed foods. Replace meat with fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains and nuts. Shift emphasis from red meat to fruits and vegetables.\n\nBecause a misunderstanding between a pilot and an air traffic controller can lead to catastrophe, the formation of a common language has made flying much safer. You might be surprised to learn that if you're taking an airline flight from a U.S. airport to some international destination — regardless of whether it’s Paris, Bogota or Beijing — your pilot will be talking to controllers on the ground in those countries in the same language, English. But it’s not a version of English that would make much sense to you, the passenger, since it’s laden with numbers, acronyms and arcane terminology, such as “Center Control, Papa November tree-niner-fife at tree-tree-zero.” The reason is that according to a set of standards and recommended practices adopted in 2003 by the International Civil Aviation Organization, pilots on international flights and air traffic controllers on their routes are required to speak a specialized version of the language known as Aviation English when they communicate over the radio.\n\nHow pilots communicate has evolved since they first began using radios in the early 1900s, according to Dominique Estival, a Western Sydney University linguist and co-author of the book “Aviation English: A lingua franca for pilots and air traffic controllers.” Initially, they used the Q Code, a sort of simplified version of Morse code, and eventually, took to speaking the letters rather than tapping them out. Between the World Wars, pilots began using the International Telecommunications Union's phonetic alphabet, in which a code word was assigned to each letter — such as “alpha” for A, and “bravo” for B — to avoid having someone mishear a letter.\n\nAviation English doesn’t have anywhere near as many words and phrases as the version of the language that most of us speak, but in some ways it’s much more complex and nuanced. Because a misunderstanding between a pilot and a controller can lead to catastrophe, Aviation English relies upon a standard phraseology, which Estival defines in an email as “a prescribed, highly constrained set of phrases to be used insofar as possible.” As a 2014 Aerosavvy.com article explains, even the pronunciation of numbers should follow precise standards for optimum clarity, so that the number four, for example, is spoken as “FOW-cr,” while three becomes “tree” without the ‘h’ sound.\n\nThere's a bit of debate about the origin of the phrase, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Some believe it’s a proverb coined by the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius; others say it’s a modern turn of phrase invented by the advertising industry at the turn of the 20th century. But no matter its origin, the phrase begs a question: If art can express more than the words, then why was the alphabet ever invented? And the answer to that question still remains a bit of a head scratcher.\n\nWriting is a relatively recent invention in human history, developed only about 5,000 years ago. For tens of thousands of years before that, history was largely handed down orally. “The creation of writing is the event that gave humanity a history,” says Lydia Wilson in the new BBC documentary, “The Secret History of Writing.” Wilson is a research associate at the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge and a visiting scholar at the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at City University of New York. “What prompted our ancestors to start writing things down, not for the ear, but for the eye?” she asks.\n\nArchaeologists have taught us that before the alphabet was invented, “written” communication was in the form of pictures, known as hieroglyphics. They are believed to have originated around 3100 BCE, not as a way to capture history, but as a method for documenting business transactions during the rise of the city-state. Scholars believe that Mesopotamia, considered the “Cradle of Civilization,” is the birthplace of many history-changing inventions and concepts, including writing.\n\nBut hieroglyphics were complicated to read and it’s believed that only a small group of scribes was able to decipher the thousands of images that represented specific words. While it’s not clear exactly when or how, researchers say sometime in the second millennium — between 1900 and 1700 BCE — an alphabetic system was developed that enabled more people to read and write.",
        "represented something that someone could recognize but at the same time that sign could be used just for the sound of the thing it looked like, so the sound became drawn out or separated from the picture,” says Irving Finkle of the British Museum in the documentary. “And, this giant leap was rather simple and it’s something which could have occurred to a child, but nevertheless is of great lasting significance.” Robert was known for his outlandish stories so we took what he said with a grain salt.

        "The world is rich. Certainly, some parts of the world are richer than others, and many millions still live in poverty. But the world is richer than it has ever been, and it continues to grow richer with each passing day.\n\nDon't believe us? Let’s compare income around the world today to some of the wealthiest countries in the past. The average income in much of the world is now greater than the average income in the world’s richest country just over a century ago. The startling level of modern wealth comes into even clearer focus when compared to the wealthiest country in 1800: Great Britain. Almost every nation in the world, with some exceptions, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, has a greater average income than the world’s leading economy just two centuries ago.\n\nModern wealth of course extends well beyond average incomes. Even in many of the poorest parts of the world, we have luxuries that our ancestors could have only dreamed of. Forget about smartphones and flat-screen TVs — even our richest ancestors would have been jealous of our indoor plumbing, electricity, vaccinations, low child mortality, and long life expectancy.\n\nWe are not heartless. There is still a tremendous amount of extreme poverty in the world. We appreciate that the entire world is not actually “rich” by current or historical standards. But the fact of the matter is that extreme poverty is in rapid decline. This decline began two centuries ago and it has accelerated in recent decades. The trends are striking. Just two centuries ago, 94% of the world lived on less than $2 a day, and 84% lived on less than $1 a day. By 2015, less than 10% of the world lived on less than $1.90 a day, and that number continues to decline. To be clear, 10% of the world is still a lot of people. But as the world continues to become richer, that number will decrease even more.\n\nIt’s not just that there has been a reduction in absolute poverty as the world has grown wealthier. More and more of the world has moved further from the edge of subsistence in the last century. Take, for instance, the relatively arbitrary milestone of $10 per day in 2018 USD. This is not much; $3,650 per year is hardly a king’s ransom. However, in most economies it is more than enough to afford the basics of life (food, shelter, clothing, etc.). This is even more true in relatively poor countries, where modest housing and food can be had cheaply.\n\nHow did the world become rich? Why are some so rich and others so poor? The answers are by no means obvious, and they are the subject of much debate among economists, historians, and other academics. This is reflective of just how important the questions are. To alleviate poverty, we must understand wealth. We still do not have all the answers, but strides have been made toward answering the question: “What do we know about how the world became rich?” Throughout most of world history, a vast majority of the world’s population — well above 90% — was poor. Whether your ancestors are from China, India, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, or elsewhere, the odds are very high that most of them lived on little more than a few dollars a day. That is clearly no longer the case. As stated earlier, the proportion of the world’s population living in extreme poverty has dropped precipitously in the last two centuries. Most of us likely live in some level of comfort, and even the poorest of us would be the envy of their ancestors. After all, they can read! How did the world get to this point? On the surface, the answer to this question is simple: the last two centuries have seen more economic growth than the rest of human history combined. Economic growth refers to a sustained increase in economic prosperity as measured by the total goods and services produced in the economy, commonly referred to as gross domestic product, or GDP. We care about economic growth not because it is an end in itself, but because it is the key to alleviating the type of poverty experienced by almost everyone who lived prior to 1800, and that still plagues way too large of a share of the world’s population today.",
        "Our focus on economic growth does not mean that we don’t value other aspects of human development. Leisure time, long life, good health, literacy, education, female empowerment, and rights and protections for the vulnerable are all central to having a happy and fair society. That said, we believe that all of these features are made possible by economic growth. It is no coincidence that the last 200 years have seen dramatic strides in those very aspects of human development. Even though there is clearly a long way to go to achieve the type of society that most of us want, economic growth will be a key part of the solution.\n\nEconomic growth on its own is not necessarily a panacea. It can be accompanied by environmental degradation, increased inequality, or worsening health outcomes. For instance, air quality declined and life expectancy fell during the British Industrial Revolution. Today, issues such as climate change and social polarization are among the most important challenges that policy-makers face. The point that deserves emphasis here is that economic growth makes available the resources and the new technologies needed to tackle these important challenges. Of course, humanity actually needs to employ these resources to address these challenges. But in the absence of economic growth, we may not have such an opportunity.\n\nIt is a mistake to think that we necessarily have to choose between economic growth and other values. For example, a more unstable climate poses potentially catastrophic risks to our society. Yet, we've seen in recent years that measures to reduce carbon emissions can be accompanied by economic growth. The UK, for example, saw carbon emissions fall by 38% between 1990 and 2017, from 600 million tonnes to 367 million tonnes. Meanwhile, total GDP (adjusted for inflation) increased by over 60% in the same period.\n\nNor do we necessarily have to choose between economic growth and a fairer society. In fact, a lack of economic growth has serious moral downsides. Historically, it is in stagnant or declining economies that one observes the worst episodes of violence, intolerance, and political polarization. On the other hand, social mobility and greater equality of opportunity are much more likely in an economy that is growing. As Benjamin Friedman puts it, stagnant economies “do not breed support for economic mobility, or for openness of opportunity more generally.” So, how has the world economy grown over time? Figure 2 gives some rough estimates of per capita GDP in the world’s most populous regions since the birth of Christ. While these numbers are admittedly speculative — and likely more volatile prior to the 18th century than the figure suggests — the pattern is clear and uncontroversial. Prior to the 19th century, the wealthiest region in the world never reached more than $4 a day average (in 2011 USD). Throughout most of world history, $2-3 a day was the norm. Yes, there were fabulously wealthy people, and these societies produced some of the greatest art, architecture, and literature the world has known (pursuits not generally associated with people on the brink of starvation). These artists and authors are the people from the past you may be the most familiar with, since they are the ones who generally fill our history books. But this was not the lot of almost the entirety of humanity prior to the 19th century. The fact is that most people who ever lived — at least, prior to the 20th century — lived in conditions very similar to those of the very poorest in the world today. The economic growth of the last two centuries has alleviated a vast majority of this poverty, although the job is clearly not finished.\n\nTo be clear, there were spurts of economic improvement here and there in the past. Jack Goldstone calls these “growth efflorescences.” One such period of economic improvement occurred in classical Greece, where there was both population growth and an increase in living standards as measured by the size and quality of homes. Other episodes were due to political pacification, such as the “Pax Islamica” over large parts of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula in the centuries following.",
        "The spread of Islam. The “Islamic Peace” permitted higher levels of trade and the spread of agricultural techniques and crops. The “Pax Mongolica,” which allowed parts of Asia to thrive in the wake of the Mongol devastations, had similar effects.\n\nAnother cause of temporary economic improvement was widespread death through disease. While plagues were undoubtedly awful for the people who lived through them — in the 14th century, the Black Death killed between a third and a half of Europe’s population and probably a similar amount in the Middle East — they did mean that there were fewer mouths to feed. Per capita income tended to rise for at least a few generations in the wake of these events. The most important cause of economic improvement, however, was technological change. New varieties of disease-resistant grains, new agricultural techniques that improved soil quality or irrigation, and improvements to the plow are all examples of new technologies that allowed more people to be fed with less labor. Yet, prior to the 18th century, all spurts of economic improvement were temporary.\n\nWhat matters in the long run is whether economic growth is continuous, which refers to the continuous growth rates that have been experienced by countries like the US and the UK since the middle of the 19th century. What is unique about developed countries today is not that they have experienced a rapid acceleration of economic growth. Many countries that are poor today have experienced growth accelerations in the past as well. What distinguishes rich countries is that they have not experienced shrinkage. For instance, US GDP has grown fairly constantly since 1870. Even the Great Depression only had a temporary impact on economic growth. The point is that prior to the first few decades of the 19th century, the continuous economic growth experienced by the UK, the US, and other developed economies in the past two centuries was all but unheard of. What was more common was periods of growth offset by periods of contraction, like that experienced by Venezuela between 2011 and 2021. Stephen Broadberry and John Wallis call this “shrinkage.” From this perspective, the main difference between rich and poor countries is not that rich countries grow fast during their periods of growth. Rich countries are those that have experienced fewer periods in which the economy has gotten smaller.\n\nSustained economic growth has been accompanied by a dramatic reorganization of society and production. This is what we refer to as economic development. By this we mean a fundamental and transformative restructuring of the economy associated with urbanization and the growth of non-agricultural sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and the service sector. This process of development was also associated with the emergence of new ways of organizing economic activity: factories, corporations, and stock markets. In contrast, before 1800, the majority of the population lived in the countryside and worked on the land. Sure, there was some variation in urbanization and the prominence of manufacturing or service sectors. In Italy between 0 and 200 CE, urbanization may have been as high as 30%. Iron production soared in Song China. Commerce and long-distance trade were important parts of the economy of late medieval Venice, Bruges, and Antwerp. Nonetheless, the structure of all of these societies was vastly simpler than that of almost any modern economy.\n\nIn the developed world, the structure of the economy is different. Importantly, agriculture has shrunk both as a proportion of the total economy and, even more dramatically, as a source of employment. Today, only 1.3% of the labor force works on the farm in the US. In the UK, the number is smaller still, just 1%. Alongside this structural shift, there has been a transformation in organizational complexity. This is most notably seen in the rise of long-lived organizations independent of the state such as corporations. These are all hallmarks of a developed economy.\n\nYou might wonder: how do we know how poor people were in the past? No country had an office of national statistics collecting information and compiling GDP estimates until the mid-20th century. Instead, social scientists and historians have had to reconstruct the past. The first exercise of this kind was the pioneering work of Angus Maddison. He spent decades creating high-quality estimates of per capita GDP back to 1820. Maddison also produced a set of highly influential estimates for earlier periods, including estimates of per capita income at the regional level for the Roman Empire. But these estimates were of much more questionable veracity. More recent work, including the Maddison project and the work of numerous scholars has produced updated estimates of per capita GDP that are on a much firmer footing.\n\nBut GDP estimates are far from the only source of information we have on past economies. Since the 19th century, economic historians have been collecting information on wages and prices in order to produce estimates of how much an unskilled worker would have been able to purchase in the past. Owing to the work of Robert Allen and others, there now exist comprehensive estimates of the purchasing power of workers for a host of European and Asian cities. Allen’s method is based on the construction of a consumption basket for a representative worker. These baskets are constructed by consulting numerous diaries and the budgets of poor houses and orphanages. A benefit of constructing consumption baskets is that it allows us to compare living standards across time and space, while remaining cognizant that people’s preferences were different in different regions at different times.",
        "Living standards can be calculated as the ratio of yearly wages to the cost of a consumption basket (total cost of food). Whereas rice would have made up a large portion of the Fast Asian diet, grains or bread would take its place in Western Europe.\n\nThere are other measures we can use to assess living standards in the past. One common measure is height. Economic historians have put together estimates of heights for many countries across many centuries. Height is determined by several factors, including genetic endowments. Height is also influenced by in vitro conditions and the nutrition available to the mother during pregnancy and as a child. We observe a strong positive relationship between gains in height and per capita GDP in the past 200 years. People in the past were short. The mean height of an 18 year old in the English army between 1763 and 1767 was 160.76 cm. The increase in average height partly reflects the improvements in nutritional standards achieved since the onset of modern economic growth.\n\nA final measure of the standard of living is F. Modern economic growth is associated with large increases in F. This matters for two reasons. First, increased F represents a significant component of the additional welfare brought about by economic growth. Second, increased F is a possible cause of economic development itself. An increase in F increases the value of investment in human capital, the term economists use to encompass education and other investments in an individual's productive capacity.\n\nThe answer to the question “How did the world become rich?” must explain where, when, and how human societies were able to achieve sustained economic growth. The where and the when we know the answer to: All of the metrics we discussed above agree on this point. It is the third question — how did the escape from stagnation happen — that is so vexing.\n\nBut you would also live in a drafty, uncomfortable castle, and you would likely have multiple children die in infancy.\n\nIf you didn’t die young on the battlefield, odds are you would die of some now-curable disease such as dysentery (which killed English kings John and Henry V), smallpox (which killed French king Louis XV and English queen Mary II), or plague.\n\nOf course, you would have servants, and you'd have the social and political benefits that come with being a member of the upper crust.\n\nSome of us might trade our current lot for that of the baron, but with these risks, many of us would not.\n\nThink about it: would you trade your current life for the life of a wealthy English baron in, say, 1200?",
        "By most measurements, the wealth of the world grew slowly in the past, but it has expanded dramatically in the last few decades, with sharp differences between countries resulting from periods of growth or stagnation. Despite improvements in the overall world economy, many people still live in poverty. Nutrition and overall health have improved, but a lack of sustained positive growth has created sharp differences in consumption. If you lived long ago, you would probably die young, but health conditions are much better now because of a reduction in poverty. In the last few years alone, resources made available by economic growth have increased wealth all over the world. Improvements in the structure of the world economy have brought positive changes to people around the world, especially mobility and openness of opportunity, resulting in a general increase in wealth. Most of the world is rich now, and economic growth is the key to improving everyone's lives. People live longer, there is less chance of getting sick and fewer people have to engage in manufacturing to survive.",

        "The Ringling Bros, and Barnum & Bailey Circus put on its last show in 2017, after more than 140 years in performance. Many factors led to the demise of the so-called “Greatest Show on Earth” — growing costs, shrinking attention spans, the rise of other forms of entertainment, the effect of local transport legislation on a show that still mostly travels by rail. But one of the loudest arguments in recent memory concerned the show’s animal performers, which came to appear more retrograde than entertaining thanks to an evolving dialogue on animal rights. Following a damning 2011 Mother Jones investigative report and ugly multi-year litigation over elephant care, the circus’s parent company, Feld Entertainment, retired its use of elephants in 2016.\n\nThe showman P.T. Barnum, who died in 1891, takes a lot of heat as the original architect of the circus; he’s widely considered the person who created cruel and callous demand for performing tigers and dancing elephants in the first place. Although there’s truth to this view, a look at Barnum’s career also reveals his surprising involvement with a movement that would, over a century later, cheer the end of his circus. Through his unlikely friendship with the prominent early animal-rights activist Henry Bergh in the late 1800s, Barnum found himself in the thick of the debate over the care and feeding of Victorian animal entertainers. In fact, the animal-rights movement might not have survived to exist in its modern form and breadth if not for the media exposure Barnum lent it in its fragile infancy.\n\nBergh, the previously idle son of a wealthy New York shipping family, founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) in 1866. Motivated by the raucous bullfights and ill-treatment of carriage horses he witnessed as he traveled through Europe, Bergh traded early retirement for a life of activism. He was easily recognizable as he strode around Manhattan looking to intervene in instances of animal abuse. If you were walking a city street in the 1860s and happened to see a tall, lanky gentleman with a giant, drooping mustache, standing in the intersection and hollering at overloaded streetcars to pull over, that was Henry Bergh. One of Bergh’s first public squabbles was with Barnum, whose two American Museums predated his circus ventures by decades, and were the most well-known public attractions in 19th-century New York. Live animals were among the museums’ biggest draws. Barnum featured the nation’s first public aquarium, with sea lions and beluga whales, an unprecedented hippopotamus, assorted birds and beasts, and even the famed mountain man John “Grizzly” Adams frolicking with enormous bears on the top floor. The museums were wildly popular and made Barnum a global celebrity well before he entered the circus business.\n\nIn 1866, after a complaint that Barnum’s staff fed the resident boa constrictor a diet of live rabbits, the newly minted activist Bergh introduced himself to Barnum with the threat of legal action. He called on museum staff personally, hoping to put an end to what he called the “semi-barbarian” practice of feeding snakes live prey before the paying public. If the snakes can’t eat anything else, Bergh urged, in a letter to Barnum, “then let them starve — for, it is contrary to the merciful providence of God that wrong should be committed in order to accomplish a supposed right.” Thanks to his menageries, Barnum had more hands-on experience with exotic animals than many scientists of the era (even if he did go through them at a faster-than-ideal rate), and maintained a solid reputation among zoologists. Seeing no issue with the snake’s diet, Barnum replied to Bergh with the concurring opinion of the Harvard scientist Louis Agassiz, an ASPCA supporter who confirmed that snakes habitually ate live food, and would in fact refuse to eat a dead meal. Barnum insisted that the American Museum would “continue to feed all its animals in accordance with the laws of nature,” and warned Bergh about being too credulous and self-righteous, particularly in public discourse: “This entire story of the trembling, fearful rabbit is a shallow hoax,” Barnum wrote, adding: “In attempting to prevent the abuse of beasts your influence will not be increased by your abuse of men.” Chastened but not dissuaded, Bergh continued his work. Granted enforcement powers under New York’s landmark animal-rights law, Bergh lobbied for the humane treatment of livestock, opposed dogfighting and cockfighting, and advocated for animal care during an 1872 disease outbreak that devastated horses and therefore debilitated a society that needed them for labor, transportation, and commerce.\n\nAlthough Bergh’s remarkable efforts enjoyed the sort of elite political and philanthropic support that nurtured many of the era’s moral movements, he was slow to build broad public backing. In the 19th century, animals were generally regarded as chattel, not as living beings with rights, and what an owner chose to do with his animals was his business. And so as Bergh patrolled the city to root out abuse, most workaday people did not see a noble humanitarian so much as a nosy aristocrat.\n\nBarnum had come out of semi-retirement in the 1870s to build the circus that bore his name. His spring show in 1880 featured the stallion Salamander, who thrilled crowds by jumping through a series of flaming hoops. Despite a then-cordial acquaintance with Barnum, Bergh protested the performance following a report that, after a hoop had slipped, the horse finished its act one night with its mane and tail appearing to be on fire. Through his manager George Bailey, Barnum explained that the flames were chemically created showpieces that posed no danger to man or beast. He even invited Bergh to a repeat",
        "performance to see for himself. Bergh declined, and in his stead sent the superintendent of the ASPCA, a clutch of animal-welfare officers, and 20 New York policemen, who sternly stationed themselves around the ring as 4,000 spectators took their seats. At the close of a bareback-riding routine, Barnum himself entered the arena to roaring applause. He calmed the crowd and announced that although he realized he might end the day under arrest, “Mr. Bergh or I must run this show.” The hoops were set ablaze as the “fire-horse” was led into the ring by his trainer. Barnum grabbed his hat and stuck his hand into the flames. Seventy years old but spirited, the entertainer stepped through the fiery hoop, and in short order he was followed by ten clowns, Salamander and, at Barnum’s invitation, Superintendent Hartfield of the ASPCA. Satisfied on the point of the horse’s safety, Hartfield and a delighted audience called victory for the entertainer. Reflecting on the performance in his autobiography, Barnum refused to crush Bergh or his agenda in that moment: “Although I was forced to resent his ill-advised interference, this episode did not impair my personal regard for Mr. Bergh and my admiration of his noble works.” Perhaps the most notable legacy of Bergh and Barnum is that despite — or perhaps because of — their public sparring, the two men developed a warm and knowing friendship that elevated the profile of animal-rights advocacy at a key historical moment. It is worth remembering that Barnum, for all his flaws, believed that his role was not simply to read the public taste and provide corresponding entertainment, but also to work toward the moral improvement of society. And he was happy to elevate a social cause so long as the tide also carried his own boat. Therefore, had he been alive, Barnum may have even encouraged the elephants’ final bow: For as much as he valued his animal performers and their role in his success, if there were a time when they went so far against public opinion as to be unmarketable, he’d have been behind the final curtain, cooking up the next big thing.",
        "Barnum and Bergh first clashed over the issue of live mice being fed to snakes at one of Barnum’s circus shows.\n\nBarnum is credited with exhibiting the first aquarium in the United States.\n\nBarnum pretended to set fire to the police superintendent’s horse’s tail to demonstrate that Bergh’s fear that burning hoops were hurting the circus animals was unfounded.\n\nBarnum was gracious to Bergh in the former’s autobiography.\n\nCircuses ran, according to the article, from 1891 until the final one in 2017.\n\nHarvard scientist Louis Agassiz supported Barnum against Bergh on the issue of feeding live food to snakes.\n\nNegative media reporting and criticism led to elephants being withdrawn from Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus performances in 2016.",
        "Andreas Cunaeus holds a Leyden jar in his right hand and reaches up to the prime conductor with his left hand. Ewald Jürgen von Kleist, dean of the cathedral in Kammin (now Kammin, Poland), tried to augment the power of a flare of static electricity by increasing the amount of electrified matter from which it sprang: The bigger the prime conductor, the bigger the shock. He ran a wire from the prime conductor into a big glass full of water as a convenient method of effecting the increase in power. No sensible improvement resulted since he insulated the vessel while filling it with electrical effluvia. He next brought a nail stuck in a little bottle filled with alcohol up to the prime conductor; hoping, apparently, to create a portable flare, he held the bottle in his hand. On touching the nail with the other hand, he got a big surprise. He shared it with some children, who were knocked off their feet by the shock. Kleist described his new power to at least five persons, of whom one was a veteran professor of experimental philosophy and another was an able member of the Berlin Academy of Science. None was able to reproduce his results. Not until March 1746, three months after Kleist had announced his striking news, did anyone working from his instructions succeed. He had forgotten to emphasize the counterintuitive step that made a condenser from a nail in a bottle: He did not say that the experimenter must grasp the outside of the bottle and stand on the floor during electrification; he did not say that the bottle’s exterior must be grounded. Without this prescription, the knowledgeable investigator, recognizing the semitransparency of glass, would use a thick bottle and insulate it and/or themselves while trying to fill it from the prime conductor.\n\nWhile Kleist was knocking down children, Pieter van Musschenbroek, professor of physics at the University of Leyden (now Leiden, Netherlands), was trying to draw fire from water. We know how Musschenbroek would have proceeded from Andreas Gordon, professor of physics at the Benedictine convent in Erfurt, a good experimenter who made important improvements in the electro-static machine. Gordon directed that the water-filled vessel rest on an insulating stand while the effluvia run into it via a wire to the prime conductor; otherwise they would leak out the bottom to ground. Here the lawyer Andreas Cunaeus intervened. After visiting Musschenbroek’s laboratory, he tried the experiment on his own. Alone and unaware that the prime conductor must be held by an insulator, he electrified the vessel in the manner most natural, by holding it in his hand. When he drew a spark from the prime conductor with the other, he let the genie out of the bottle.\n\nCunaeus showed Musschenbroek and his assistant how they too could blast themselves with electricity. “I thought I was done for,” the professor then wrote to René-Antoine Réaumur, his correspondent at the Paris Academy, adding precise directions for realizing the “terrible experiment” and advice not to try it. The courageous Jean-Antoine Nollet, informed by Réaumur, bent himself double and knocked out his wind. Others who tried the experiment reported nose bleedings, temporary paralysis, concussions, convulsions, and dizziness. The gallant Johann Heinrich Winkler warned that his wife was unable to walk after he used her to short a Leyden jar. These exaggerations suggest how flagrantly the action of the condenser violated received ideas about electricity. The current theories could not predict the outcome of events. If, by a slight simplification of previous experiments, one could create a blow of unprecedented power, might not a trivial alteration of the Leyden experiment itself transport an unlucky electrician into the next world? Frank admissions that the jar shattered accepted theory appeared on every hand. Musschenbroek, hitherto an authority, now “understood nothing and could explain nothing” about electricity. It appeared that the Leyden experiment was “different in kind” from the classical repertory of experiments in electricity. Perhaps the powers of frictional and communicated electricity differ.",
        "one resourceful commentator supposed — electricity expressed itself in contradictory ways according to the experiment tried. No one was killed or even injured by the Leyden jar. Reports of experiments became soberer. By the end of 1746, consensus had been reached on several facts and errors. Nollet found that the shape of the vessel did not matter but that its substance had to be glass or porcelain. The latter proposition placed an unproductive emphasis on the supposed uniqueness of glass. The former proposition resulted in a piece of glass with metal foil on both sides. Physicists found three ways besides external coating to enlarge their shocks: Daniel Gralath connected jars in parallel into what he called a “battery”; Nollet increased the size of the prime conductor; Gralath and Benjamin Watson found the bottle the fiercer the thinner the glass. A battery of thin-walled jars shorted through the body hit like a club. “The first time I experienced it, it seemed to me as though my arm were struck off at my shoulder, elbow and wrist, and both my legs, at the knees, and behind the ankles,” Watson reported.\n\nScience is a social enterprise. Let a gentleman hold the jar and a lady the prime conductor; both feel the shock when they touch. How many others can be inserted in the train? The Academician Louis-Guillaume Le Monnier tried 140 courtiers, before the king; Nollet shocked 180 soldiers in the same presence. Only persons in the train felt the shock; those in side chains branching from the main line felt nothing. Thus, electricians discovered that the discharge — to use the word they introduced for the climax of the Leyden experiment — goes preferentially along the best conducting circuit between the inside and outside of the jar. Using the same detectors, they learned that the best is not always the shortest. In one demonstration, only those at the extremes of the chain felt the shock. The shock was found to occur only when the train stood on moist ground; apparently the discharge went through the arms and legs of the extreme members and completed its course in the soil.\n\nThe charged jar was also intriguing when innocently insulated. It unaccountably preserved its punch for hours or even days; even when grounded externally, it remained potent provided its top wire was not touched. With its bottom or tail insulated, no explosion, but only a small spark, could be produced by touching the head wire connected with its internal coating. It could then be revivified, or made capable of the Leyden shock, merely by holding it in the hand. This behavior defied explanation or, indeed, any articulation based on the old theories that presupposed certain characteristics of glass.",

The length of time that a Leyden jar holds a charge can be increased by connecting them in parallel. The phenomena produced by the Leyden jar invalidated the theories of electricity that were current in the mid-18th century.",
        "Elspeth Stuckey’s 1991 book The Violence of Literacy was translated into Japanese by Kyuichi Kikuchi in 1995. In sharing Stuckey’s perspectives on literacy, Kikuchi insists that literacy crucially involves issues of authority and power. Both Stuckey and Kikuchi point out the negative influence of subscribing to the idea of a “single literacy.” They criticize the privileged position of western-style school literacy, which is protected and promoted by powerful institutions. Kikuchi’s work is important, because he shows how literacy serves also as a tool for social control. Literacy, he maintains, monopolizes the construction of social knowledge. This view has gradually spread across Japanese sociolinguistics.\n\nYukitoshi Sunano studies the hegemonic power of the idea of a single literacy and analyzes it as a mechanism of social exclusion. He distinguishes between three categories of literacy comprehension: (1) literacy as a project of the modern age, (2) literacy as an ideological device, and (3) literacy as a mechanism of exclusion. Consider these three perspectives in more detail: To start, literacy is a product of the modern age that has laid the foundation for the construction of the “citizen.” Hence, literacy is linked to concepts of enlightenment such as “freedom,” “citizenship,” and “democracy”; that is, key ideas used to break free from the limits of feudal society. In order to accomplish discourse in the public sphere under democratic values, acquiring literacy became seen as a precondition for the existence of modern societies. By looking at literacy through such “modernist lenses,” western-style schooling comes to be seen as the central institution responsible for spreading literacy.\n\nThe idea of literacy as an ideological device presents literacy as a product of the modern age where people are integrated into the nation in order to control them. Sunano identifies critical literacy as an important concept in order to overcome the limits of the idea of standard literacy.\n\nLast, literacy as a mechanism of exclusion highlights the existence of a demarcation line by literacy. When literacy is connected to a writing system too complicated for ordinary people to learn, then the establishment can monopolize it. In other words, literacy becomes a tool to control illiterate people. This is how literacy functioned in feudal societies. Literacy as a product of the modern age appears to disrupt this mechanism of excluding people. However, contrary to what most people think, the exclusivity characteristic of literacy remains intact in modern societies. The idea of “single literacy,” owned and controlled by the establishment, is part and parcel of such mechanisms of exclusion.\n\nFrom these three points of view, the stigma of being illiterate emerges as the result of social rejection through the exclusionary function of literacy. It can also be connected to the global tendency of stigmatizing the illiterate, an idea that UNESCO and other institutions inadvertently reproduce through some of their campaigns. In spite of their philanthropic efforts, negative connotations are inherent in slogans such as “eradication of illiteracy.” The excluding function of literacy is not resolved in this way. It continues to do its work. Next, we will discuss concrete examples demonstrating how literacy results in exclusion in Japanese contexts.\n\nThe contemporary Japanese writing system is beyond doubt very difficult. The number of “general-use kanji” is presently limited to 2,136 characters. However, many more kanji are used in daily life. Most kanji have at least two pronunciations, further complicating the Japanese script. Literacy in Japanese is widely associated with the ability to read, write, and remember an enormous number of kanji. The term monmo literally means “sentence-blindness”; thus, we can see a deep tie between illiteracy and disability already in the term monmo. This notwithstanding, literacy studies in Japan have avoided discussing the literacy of people with disabilities. It is no exaggeration to say that people with disabilities have been excluded from literacy studies.\n\nIn order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of exclusion through literacy and disabilities, Tomoyuki Sumi flatly rejects the popular myth that the literacy rate of Japan stands at 99%. The main pillar of this myth is a survey conducted after WWII under the US occupation. Results of an extensive literacy survey conducted in 1948 were published by a Research Committee for Literacy as a report titled Survey on the Literacy of the Japanese People. It consisted of 90 questions that included hiragana, katakana, and kanji, both used independently and intermixed. The survey was conducted among 21,008 Japanese, who had been invited to participate in this survey by postcards using kanji and kana mixed orthography, between the ages of 15 and 64 years across 270 municipalities. The results showed that 4.4% had perfect scores, while 1.7% had scored zero. These 1.7% serve as the basis to claim that 99% of the Japanese population is literate, which is surprising given that the report itself states that “the literate criteria is only fulfilled by a perfect score.” If this procedure had been applied, the literacy rate according to this survey would have been 4.4%, an equally inappropriate result. What matters for our discussion here is simply that the “total literacy myth” was built upon a problematic survey methodology (written invitations) and a one-sided interpretation of the results (everyone who did not score zero is literate).\n\nAt the time the survey was conducted, there was an intense debate on the Japanese language and its",
        "Some placed a high value on the phonographic writing system and argued to abolish kanji altogether, while others advocated the continued use of kanji. Needless to say, those in support of maintaining kanji used the results of the literacy survey to advance their cause. They created the 99% literacy myth, according to Hitoshi Yamashita. This myth then spread around the world. Consider a statement cited by the International Bureau of Education and UNESCO two decades after the survey: “The problem of illiteracy has been solved completely. Modern Japanese is usually transcribed in Japanese syllabaries (48 phonetic letters) and kanji (1,850 words, ideographs for the most part). A person is considered illiterate if he is unable to read and write these words and letters at all.” This was the official statement made at an international conference on public education by the Japanese Ministry of Education.\n\nHowever, different ideological positions on language led to different interpretations of the survey results. It is for this reason that Sumi returns to a discussion of the 1948 survey in order to examine the effects of this myth on parts of Japanese society. Sumi stresses that this official position cannot be tenable already for the fact that this number obviously excludes people with mental or physical disabilities. In 1948, people with disabilities were not enrolled in the education system; many remained illiterate for their entire lives as a result. Their illiteracy was hidden to help sustain the literacy myth, allowing the Japanese government to boast about the efficiency of its educational system. In short, then: the number of illiterate Japanese is higher than claimed, some individuals are illiterate as a result of discrimination, and discrimination in Japanese society is not sufficiently reflected upon.",
        "Here, this notwithstanding means consequently. Here, tenable means justified. Choose the FOUR statements that do NOT AGREE with what the passage says. You must NOT choose more than FOUR statements. An important survey on Japanese literacy rates was undertaken during the US occupation. Official statements made by the Japanese government have spread false information about Japanese literacy rates around the world. People with mental and physical disabilities are usually excluded from statistical surveys conducted by international organizations. The concept of literacy can function as a way to control people. The high literacy rate of Japan is considered to be declining because of a new research methodology aligned to the global standard. There was a time when some people proposed discontinuing the use of kanji in the Japanese writing system. UNESCO and other institutions are viewed to have liberated the oppressed in modern societies by eradicating illiteracy. Western-style schooling was rejected in Japan because it was felt that the difference in writing systems made it inappropriate.\n\nWrite a paragraph in ENGLISH giving your opinion on the statement below, with appropriate reasons to support your position.

        "Tacos are an internationally popular hand-sized food item of Mexican origin combining seasoned meat, vegetables, and other fillings and served inside a folded or rolled corn or flour tortilla. Maize has been domesticated in Mexico for at least 9,000 years, and one of the first uses of ground maize was very likely the tortilla, a flatbread made of maize, ground lime, and water. The name taco may come from the Spanish word for dowel, as in a plug to fill a hungry stomach, or, perhaps likelier, from the Nahuatl word tlacoyo, the name of a related foodstuff. The taco is made of that bread base, but its ingredients thereafter can be various. In Mexican cuisine, tacos can contain beef, chicken, pork, fish, and shellfish as well as vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, radishes, chiles, and tomatoes. Tacos can also be vegetarian, filled with retried beans, avocado, potatoes, and cheese.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico, the meats eaten in tacos were likely reptiles such as snakes and iguanas, as well as native mammals and birds such as armadillos and turkeys; insects such as grasshoppers were (and are) eaten in tacos as well. With the arrival of Eurasian livestock, tacos acquired a yet more diverse protein base. The Spanish also introduced cheese, lettuce and cabbage, and other foodstuffs, adding to foods of South American origin such as tomatoes, potatoes, and chiles. It is said that if the typical taco were to visit the origins of each of its ingredients, it would have to travel some 64,000 miles.\n\nThe taco remains a staple of Mexican cuisine, sold in fine restaurants and street stalls alike. It has also enjoyed international success, embraced everywhere it has landed. In the United States, where “taco Tuesday” has become common nationwide, it is estimated that there are some 50,000 Mexican restaurants, nearly all of them offering tacos. Mexican restaurants abound in major cities in Europe, Oceania, and East Asia, and local variations have been recorded. In South Korea, for example, diners enjoy tacos with the customary ingredients and also with the addition of kimchi."

        "Pre-school children learn the meanings of more than ten new words each day, and they understand the meanings of those words well enough to use them in fluent communication. They use these words to express a welter of opinions on what they think is good or bad, right or wrong, and all too readily wail “It’s not fair!”. But how can a young child — and the rest of us — really know what these words mean? After all, the most brilliant thinkers across millennia have found that these everyday notions — goodness, the difference between right and wrong, the nature of fairness — are sunk in conceptual quicksand. How can young children master concepts that philosophers struggle to analyse?\n\nThe answer is that philosophers wrestle with the challenge of providing a general theory of “deep” concepts to explain the fundamental meaning of such notions as good, fair, cause, mind and so on. But children and adults only have to get meaning sufficiently clear to deal with the specific communicative challenge of the moment. To communicate successfully, a cry of “It’s not fair!” must express the outrage a child feels when given a smaller slice of cake or made to wait in a queue. But this communication does not require the child (or the unfortunate parent) to have a general theory of fairness in mind. Indeed, the “meaning” that allows us to get by successfully is often shallow.\n\nConsider, for example, how children use alive and dead. Susan Carey, a developmental psychologist at Harvard, had the following instructive and rather delightful interchanges with her daughter Eliza on the subject. When someone is shot on a TV programme, Eliza (three years and six months) explains: “He’s dead — I can tell because he’s not moving.” This seems similar to how we adults define dead. But then, Carey asks about Eliza’s toy bear: E: ... She’ll always be alive.\n\nS: Is she alive? E: No — she’s dead. HOW CAN THAT BE? S: Is she alive or dead? E: Dead.\n\nS: Did she used to be alive? E: No, she’s middle-sized in between alive and dead. She moves sometimes.\n\nAnd then comes the astonishing question: E: How do dead people go to the bathroom? S: What? E: Maybe they have bathrooms under the ground.\n\nS: Dead people don’t have to go to the bathroom. They don’t do anything; they just lie there. They don’t eat or drink, so they don’t have to go to the bathroom. E: But they ate or drank before they died — they have to go to the bathroom from just before they died.\n\nEliza doesn’t, surely, have a clear and distinct concept of alive and dead. Her toy bear is not alive; but then again, her bear moves sometimes, so it must be alive, or perhaps it’s in some intermediate state. And dead people are, it seems, still carrying on with normal bodily functions. On a separate occasion (aged three years and eight months) she exclaims: “Isn’t it funny — statues aren’t alive, but you can still see them?” Her grandfather is not alive, and you can’t see him, she notes.\n\nEliza is clearly a very observant reasoner. And she is also an astute player of verbal charades. People throw around the words alive and dead, but what are they getting at? Well, dead things don’t seem to move; and you can’t go to see dead people. But the idea that alive and dead only apply to biological organisms — which seems so central from an adult perspective — seems to be absent or perhaps only for Eliza. What is really astonishing is that, in most of our interactions with pre-school children, we mostly don’t have the faintest inkling that their understanding of words is so different from ours. Just as with the interpretation of actions and gestures in charades, children learn to understand words well enough to make sense of the current, specific context in which they hear a word used. The motionless person who has been shot is called dead. Relatives and pets — who are no longer seen — are also described as dead. Young children can create their own charades for the adults around them, using those same words remarkably well — in fact, well enough that huge conceptual contradictions (such as toy bears being both alive and dead) almost never show up in daily conversation.\n\nBut the same issues arise when adults communicate. What is it, precisely, to be alive? Typical biology textbooks can do no better than a descriptive list: living things grow, reproduce, eat and excrete, regulate their internal chemistry and temperature, are composed of one or more cells, pass on their traits through their genes and so on. But this leaves tricky cases such as viruses (not composed of cells, not able to reproduce independently), viroids (circular RNA strands that replicate autonomously inside a host plant), prions (infectious proteins), and even the androids of the future (could a machine be conscious without being alive?). The definition of life, like the definitions of good, justice, right and wrong, has been the subject of endless and unresolved debates for millennia. And our conception of life is full of contradictions. Wouldn’t an afterlife be a type of life? And if so, should the biological criteria",
        "be mostly thrown out? The people in an imagined afterlife aren’t actually dead, are they? And what about cryogenic freezing — is suspended animation a form of life, or death, or does it fall somewhere in between? These types of questions are mostly irrelevant in the vast majority of linguistic charades we play in everyday communication — the tricky cases just don’t arise much in ordinary conversation. What matters is that we can get along well enough when dealing with the situations that actually occur in daily life. We no more need a mental definition of life to talk about living relatives or dead pets than we need a biological definition of gorillas to mime King Kong. Both pre-school children and adults use words as players use gestures in charades — in creative, contradictory ways that are good enough to get through the language games of the moment. In learning a language, we are learning to play creative conversational games with words. And playing those conversational games requires paying attention to likely communicative objectives, the contents of the environment, and past linguistic usage — the hidden parts of the communication iceberg are just as important as the words themselves.",
        "Most people need not be concerned by philosophical questions of meaning. We need to memorize the definitions of words that other people use. People have numerous reasons to negotiate the meanings of life and death. Children’s games are an important part of learning about life and death.\n\nPeople are able to communicate clearly using words because we already share a common understanding. We are constantly negotiating the meaning of different concepts even in daily interactions. Young children play charades because they are not good at using language the same way as adults. People in different countries use different nonverbal strategies to communicate when they lack the vocabulary to speak.",
        "Modern historians count 1967 as an especially busy year: the six-day war, the summer of love, Sgt Pepper, the first recorded deaths of American astronauts, the founding of the suburban utopia of Milton Keynes. And also, half-forgotten in the crush, perhaps the most consequential event of all: the invention of the first device ever that permitted us to henceforward stop using a part of our brains.\n\nA young Dallas engineer named Jerry Merryman and his team gave us, courtesy of his employers, Texas Instruments, the Cal-Tech electronic calculator. For $400 you could own a shirt-pocket-sized plastic box with buttons and symbols that, if pressed, would answer in an instant, and with impeccable accuracy, any simple arithmetical question you might ask it. And most important, it performed its work invisibly. The abacus and the slide rule might have been mental labour-saving devices, but they still required you to make some use of your grey matter; the Cal-Tech freed you up entirely, removing all mathematical tedium from your daily life.\n\nIt was semiconductors and algorithms that helped make Merryman’s magic, and for the 60 years since, and in the hands of other similarly blessed engineers, they have continued to do so, relentlessly. Their gifts have been all we might ever have wished for. Our brains can now relax. Whatever cerebral nooks and crannies we employed, for instance, to read paper maps, or to use sextants and compasses and chronometers to find out where we were, have now been put into cold storage: GPS has given us all the direction we might ever need. Not sure how to spell a word or how best to compose a sentence? From the 1980s onward there has been no urgent further need for an OED or a copy of Fowler’s Modern English Usage: Commodore’s WordCheck and its successors have such matters taken care of.\n\nAnd after the presentation in April 1998 at a conference in Brisbane by two (now very rich) young Americans named Page and Brin, of their paper The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine, we had Google, which, for the past quarter-century, has been able to answer all our questions about just about anything in microseconds. OpenAI is currently inventing even more advanced things that promise to blow out of the water whatever still remains of the requirement to do mental work.\n\nThis has in recent months led to widespread hand-wringing. Our minds, it is said, will inevitably fall out of use, atrophying, or distending, whichever is worse. The nightmare model — for our bodies — is a movie like Wall-E, that dystopian vision from 2008 in which humans, having abandoned their polluted and garbage-choked world, live out their lives in cocoons suspended in suborbital space. Here they have evolved into flaccid slobs, marooned in recliners, fed on high-calorie mush from squeeze-packs while gazing glassily at telescreens.\n\nSo now there comes a similarly dire vision for our minds. With machines doing all our daily mental tasks for us, our brains will become literally thoughtless, our minds a haven for endless daydreaming. We will become spiritually moribund. As inherent knowledge vanishes, no longer much needed since it is now always on tap at the slightest brush of a touch-glass surface, the concept of human wisdom, which is after all a mix of knowledge and experience, will evaporate. Society will slowly flounder and decay, body, mind and soul.\n\nThis is one vision of our future doom. But I am not a doomsayer — not so far as our minds are concerned, at least. I challenge the notion that all is now going to intellectual decline. Rather I see ample reason for optimism. And I draw this from the sextet of Ancient Greeks who laid the foundations for and defined the very idea of knowledge: Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus and Euclid. These figures, rightly revered and sanctified by time, had minds essentially little different from the finest of our own today — except in one important respect: there was, in the centuries in which these men lived, so much less for them to know.\n\nKarl Popper’s droll and much-quoted remark that “knowledge is finite but ignorance is infinite” is objectively true, of course — and yet the amount of knowledge in our contemporary mental universe is immeasurably more vast than that in which the intellectual elite of classical times existed. These six and their like travelled little (Aristotle excepted), existing in a world necessarily circumscribed by so little known geography, by very much less history, by the existence of so little written prior description. Their minds, though steeped in the totality of contemporary knowledge, were thus almost tabulae rasae — nearly empty, ready to think, primed for purpose.\n\nWhich is why our modern minds, once they have been purged of all that today’s algorithms might now deem unnecessary information, will be as ready as theirs were to think, to inquire, to wonder, to contemplate, to imagine, to create. So I see today’s algorithmic revolution as a necessary cleansing, a movement by which we rid ourselves of all the accumulated bricolage of modern intellectual life, returning us to a more reasonable sound-to-noise ratio, gifting us with a renewed innocence, filled with potential.\n\nFanciful though it may sound, this new-made post-AI society could even see the emergence of a new Euclid, a new Plato, a new Herodotus. Such figures may now be waiting in the wings, ready to rise.",
        "from the ashes of whoever created Milton Keynes, maybe to write us a new edition of the Ethics, or teach us afresh the true worth of human happiness, as Aristotle did so impeccably, 2,500 years ago. If that is the true benefit of clearing our minds of the busywork that is perhaps best left to electronic others, then I can hardly wait.",
        "For decades, researchers, hospice caregivers and stunned family members have watched with awe as people with Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia suddenly regain their memories and personalities just before death. To their family members it might seem like a second lease on life, but for many experienced medical workers, it can be a sign the end is near. Christopher Kerr, chief executive officer and chief medical officer at the Center for Hospice and Palliative Care in Buffalo, N.Y., has studied the lucid visions of several hundred terminally ill people. He says these events usually occur in the last few days of life. Such terminal lucidity is defined as the unexpected return of cognitive faculties such as speech and connectedness with other people, according to George Mason University’s Andrew Peterson, a researcher of bioethics and consciousness who co-authored a study of the phenomenon commissioned by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThis connectedness goes beyond the return of lost communication ability and situational awareness. One thing that seems to be quite significant for family members who observe lucidity is something we call the ‘old self emerging,’ Peterson says. There seems to be clear evidence that they're aware not merely of their surroundings but additionally understanding what their relationships to other people are — be it the use of a nickname or a reference to a longstanding inside joke.\n\nAs surprising as these events might seem, they are quite common. Our study wasn’t a prevalence study, says Jason Karlawish, a gerontologist at the Penn Memory Center and senior principal investigator of the NIH study. Nevertheless, he adds, what we found is lucidity was more common than it was the exception in dementia patients, which would suggest that the idea of it being terminal is not entirely correct. Instead he suggests that episodes of lucidity should be seen as part of the overall experience rather than as isolated events. We've actually found that a variety of these episodes occurred months, even years, before the person died, Karlawish notes. Even so, many experts including Kerr and Parnia agree that most of these episodes are associated with the approach of death. It’s almost like they’re preparing themselves to die, Parnia says.\n\nThe potential implications of these widespread, temporary cognitive resurgences are profound. It suggests there may be neural networks that are remaining, and/or pathways and neural function, that could help potentially restore cognitive abilities to individuals we otherwise think are permanently impaired, Peterson says. Despite this uncertainty, other research into brain activity near or at the time of death could provide scientists and clinicians greater insight into some of the processes occurring in the diseased and dying brain.\n\nIn a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in May, researchers at the University of Michigan observed a surge of organized brain activity in two out of four comatose people who were undergoing cardiac arrest after being removed from life support. This work built on more than a decade of animal research, including a 2013 PNAS study that revealed a similar surge in synchronized brain activity in rats exposed to a cardiac toxin and a 2015 study in which rats were killed by asphyxiation. In all of these investigations, the researchers found that gamma-wave activity surged within the first few minutes of cardiac arrest and then ceased. Gamma waves are a frequency of brain wave typically associated with wakefulness, alertness and memory recall.\n\nJimo Borjigin, a neurologist and an associate professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the University of Michigan, was involved in all three studies. The surge of gamma waves in dying subjects was particularly intense in a brain region Borjigin refers to as the “posterior cortical hot zone,” located near the back of the skull. Some other researchers believe this region may also be essential to conscious experience. The parts of the brain in this area are related to visual, auditory and motion perception — a phenomenon Borjigin believes is involved in the out-of-body experiences reported by people who come close to death and recover. She adds that gamma-wave activation patterns akin to those observed in the comatose people are associated with activities that include the recognition of a familiar image — such as a human face — in healthy people.\n\nIn both the human and animal studies, the subjects’ brain showed a spike in activity after the sudden reduction of oxygen supply, Borjigin says. It starts to activate this homeostatic mechanism to get oxygen back, either by breathing harder or making your heart beat faster, she adds. Borjigin hypothesizes that much of the surge in more complex brain activity observed in humans and animals undergoing cardiac arrest is also a result of the brain attempting to reestablish homeostasis, or biological equilibrium, after detecting a lack of oxygen. She further speculates that these survival mechanisms may be involved in other changes in cognition surrounding death. I believe dementia patients’ terminal lucidity may be due to these kinds of last-ditch efforts of the brain to preserve itself as physiological systems fail, Borjigin says.\n\nNYU Langone’s Parnia agrees that the brain's reaction to the loss of oxygen is at least partially responsible for lucid experiences surrounding death. Between 2017 and 2020 Parnia led a study called",
        "AWARE II, in which researchers monitored the brain activity of more than 500 critically ill people in the U.S. and U.K. who were receiving CPR. The patients were exposed to audiovisual stimuli while undergoing CPR to test their memory of events after cardiac arrest. Those who survived were later interviewed about how aware they were during the resuscitation process. According to Parnia, one in five survivors reported lucid experiences that occurred after their heart stopped. The AWARE II team also observed an unexpected spike in brain activity during CPR, he says. “Within 20 seconds of cardiac arrest, the brain flatlines,” Parnia says. Yet “usually within five minutes — but it could be longer — we're seeing a reemergence of a transient period of brain electricity.” He adds that the frequencies of brain activity observed are similar to those associated with conscious experience.\n\nParnia believes the dying brain loses the usual suppression mechanisms that allow us to focus on individual tasks during our day-to-day lives. “When you die, your brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, so it shuts down,” Parnia says. “This shutting down process takes away the brakes..., and suddenly what seems to be happening is: it gives you access to parts of your brain that you normally can’t access. All your thoughts or your memories or your interactions with everyone else come out.” But he stresses that the experiences of people undergoing cardiac arrest are lucid, not merely hallucinations. “They’re not delusional,” Parnia says of the resuscitated people he studied, and what they’re experiencing is “not dreams or hallucinations.” Although his previous studies focused on resuscitated critically ill people, Parnia believes that terminal lucidity in people who are comatose or have dementia may be the product of a similar process. He is currently participating in a study on the latter phenomenon.\n\nA full explanation for the conscious experiences of dying people remains elusive. But research increasingly paints a picture of death as an incredibly active and complex process — and, perhaps more importantly, “a humanized one,” as Kerr describes it. As for people with dementia, Karlawish says that rather than assuming their consciousness has been irrevocably changed, “we should still pay close attention to their mind because some aspects are still there, though they may be quite damaged.”",
        "Several seconds before cardiac arrest, brain activity was found to disappear. Researchers monitored the brain activities of critically ill people. Patients’ memory of the resuscitation process was explored. Researchers observed an unexpected spike in brain activity during CPR.\n\nIt can be reasonably inferred from the article that the author questions the idea that cognitive decline is a one-way process. What is the most appropriate title for this article? What happens in people’s brains when they undergo cardiac arrest? How does brain science explain life and death? Why dying people often experience a burst of lucidity?",

Society will slowly flounder and decay, body, mind and soul.\n\nThis is one vision of our future doom. But I am not a doomsayer — not so far as our minds are concerned, at least. I challenge the notion that all is now going to intellectual hell. Rather I see ample reason for optimism. And I draw this hope from the sextet of Ancient Greeks who laid the foundations for and defined the very idea of knowledge: Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus and Euclid.\n\nThese figures, rightly revered and sanctified by time, had minds essentially little different from the finest of our own today — except in one important respect: there was, in the centuries in which these men lived, so much less for them to know.\n\nKarl Popper’s droll and much-quoted remark that “knowledge is finite but ignorance is infinite” is objectively true, of course — and yet the amount of knowledge in our contemporary mental universe is immeasurably more vast than that in which the intellectual elite of classical times existed. These six and their like travelled little, existing in a world necessarily circumscribed by so little known geography, by very much less history, by the existence of so little written prior description.",
        "Their minds, though steeped in the totality of contemporary knowledge, were thus almost tabulae rasae — nearly empty, ready to take it all in, ready to think, primed for purpose. Which is why our modern minds, once they have been purged of all that today’s algorithms might now deem unnecessary information, will be as ready as theirs were to think, to inquire, to wonder, to contemplate, to imagine, to create. So I see today’s algorithmic revolution as a necessary cleansing, a movement by which we rid ourselves of all the accumulated bricolage of modern intellectual life, returning us to a more reasonable sound-to-noise ratio, gifting us with a renewed innocence, filled with potential. Fanciful though it may sound, this new-made post-AI society could even see the emergence of a new Euclid, a new Plato, a new Herodotus. Such figures may now be waiting in the wings, ready to rise from the ashes of whoever created Milton Keynes, maybe to write us a new edition of the Ethics, or teach us afresh the true worth of human happiness, as Aristotle did so impeccably, 2,500 years ago. If that is the true benefit of clearing our minds of the busywork that is perhaps best left to electronic others, then I can hardly wait.",
        "In the past fifty years or so, all kinds of digital technologies have made the lives of the average human being in developed countries a lot easier. At the same time, however, more and more people seem to be concerned that ongoing developments in artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually have disastrous effects on both our minds and bodies. According to the article by Simon Winchester, however, there is no need to be pessimistic. While Winchester may have a point when it comes to tasks for which we do not really need our intellect, I would like to argue that it is naive to think that advances in AI will free our minds and give us more time to contemplate life. Rather, it seems to me that the more we rely on AI, the busier our brains will be.\n\nTo begin with, Winchester is not very clear about what he has in mind when he talks about ‘unnecessary information’. He starts his article with a discussion of the invention of the electronic calculator, but needless to say, widespread use of this device has not led to the removal of arithmetic from school curriculums. Likewise, although GPS is a useful tool, it has driven many people nuts because of its tendency to give wrong directions. So as long as GPS cannot be completely trusted, it will be necessary for us to know how to read a map. Of course I agree that, generally speaking, these inventions make our lives easier, but the point is that we still need basic knowledge about arithmetic and map reading.\n\nRelated to this, I would like to raise some issues concerning recent developments in machine translation. Since the release of ChatGPT, a chatbot that apparently does a better job at writing essays than the average student, I have thought a lot about the possibility that in the future people may not need to learn a foreign language anymore. In fact, this scenario is predicted by the linguist Nicholas Ostler in his 2010 book The Last Lingua Franca: English Until the Return of Babel. According to Ostler, the need for a lingua franca like English will soon disappear because machine translation will do the work for us. Personally, I don’t like the idea of people not learning foreign languages anymore. As a student of the English language, I feel very much enriched by being able to see the world through the lens of a language that is completely different from my own mother tongue, and I think that alone is already reason enough to study a foreign language. Moreover, pure reliance on machine translation would make it impossible for people to judge whether the information that is exchanged really consists of faithful translations of the original words. Therefore, it seems to be important to keep providing and stimulating foreign language education in schools and universities to make sure that there remain enough bilingual or multilingual people in the world. In other words, knowledge of foreign languages should surely not be treated as ‘unnecessary information’.\n\nThere is also a lot of false, misleading, and harmful ‘information’ on the Internet. This is the kind of ‘content’ that in my opinion should be made subject to cleansing. If we don’t want to put restrictions on the possibility for anyone to upload junk or nonsense, it is all the more important that children receive a good education in which they learn to evaluate the large amount of information thrown at them. What we want is large numbers of empty minds surfing the Internet.\n\nAlthough for quite a different reason, I agree with the author that — if we manage to keep our earth livable — we should not be too pessimistic about the future of human intellectual life. As I have tried to show above, the more we rely on AI, the more important it will be for us to keep using our brains. The most important thing, therefore, is that we keep reminding ourselves of the importance of education.",
        "So I see today’s algorithmic revolution as a necessary cleansing. Fanciful though it may sound, this new-made post AI-society could even see the emergence of a new Euclid, a new Plato, a new Herodotus.\n\nAs our reliance on AI increases, will our brains need to work more, or will they need to work less? According to Kayne, scientists need to study global warming and its causes and effects. However, I strongly agree with Kim’s point that extreme weather events such as larger storms and wildfires are likely to become more frequent. White’s study shows/suggests that in her article, Brown says, “humans are responsible for climate change.” While this may be true, ..."

        "In the mid-1990s my wife served as the United Nations human rights officer in Liberia. At the time, I had just started writing for the magazine New York, and my editor did not have the Liberian civil war high on his list of most urgent topics. But I was lucky — my editor was understanding enough to let me write about the war for The New York Times Magazine, my first legitimate foreign assignment.\n\nEverything about the Liberian civil war was unusual and terrible and fascinating. I was especially taken, though, by the Liberian press — a group of reporters, editors, and photographers who were aggressive, clever, and determined. There was not enough food in Monrovia, no clean water, barely any electricity, yet the press somehow found enough ink and paper to produce some astonishing journalism.\n\nThe strange thing is that, after all this time, it is an advertisement from these Liberian papers that I remember most clearly. It was an ad that helped me understand — in a real lightning strike of understanding — the best way to approach magazine writing and editing, which I was just then learning.\n\nThe ad was for a local butcher shop and read “All Parts of the Cow.” “All Parts of the Cow” has stayed with me for almost thirty years because it became the way I explain the difference between newspaper writing and magazine writing.\n\nLike many magazine people, I started in newspapers, and I loved the work: the adrenaline, the urgency, the high-pressure collaboration. When I was a novice reporter on the night police beat at The Washington Post, I once left the newsroom at four a.m., wandered to the basement pressroom, and grabbed an actually hot-off-the-presses copy of the morning’s paper, one with my signed article on the front page. At the bottom, but never mind. It still felt great.\n\nWhat I’m about to say is not meant to be a criticism of newspapers or newspaper people. Obviously, newspapers, especially the big national papers, are stuffed with creative, brave, and talented people who are also, by the way, helping to save our democracy, which is no small thing.\n\nThe problem I had was twofold: First was the amount of clichés. On the police desk, we joked that the city had only two types of streets: “quiet, tree-lined streets” or “trash-scattered, drug-plagued streets.” I once made a joke about it, but he didn’t have time to get the joke.\n\nCliché is everywhere, especially in writing. Clichés are one of the prices we pay in journalism for speed, but alertness and a brisk pre-edit scrub will eliminate most of them.\n\nThe second problem: In newspaper editing it is common to remove wild feeling, weird detail, irregular observation, and the disturbing dynamics of writers interacting with their subjects and the world. A smart New Yorker editor, the late John Bennet, once told me that the real bias in journalism is toward consistency, and though there are other biases — of course — this seemed undoubtedly true. This unexamined bias causes us to think that stories have beginnings, middles and endings, that all questions must be answered, and that everything that happens in the universe happens for a reason.\n\nMagazine people, generally speaking, have a different understanding: Not every story has an ending; not every story even has a beginning. Not everything has to make sense. Not everything is knowable. And most importantly, something that always and forever adds confusion and complexity to story making: The presence of writers (and their experiences, beliefs, personalities, histories, and dispositions) inevitably changes the reality of whatever the writers are observing and describing. “Put it in, put it all in,” is an efficient way to describe this style of editing. Another way to describe it: “All parts of the cow.”\n\nLast year, when I asked Jennifer Senior, who had just joined the staff of The Atlantic, if she had anything original to say about the twentieth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (originality traditionally being scarce on anniversaries of world-historical events), she thought for a minute and then said, “Maybe, but it’s complicated.” The story she sketched for me then was something more than complicated. It was exquisitely personal, and it featured — of all people — a 9/11 truther, “A good man,” Jen said, something never previously said by sane people about 9/11 truthers. We talked and talked and talked. And then I thought, “All parts of the cow,” and I said, “Let’s try it.” Just put it all in. And then Jen and her editor, Scott Stossel, made something magical happen, and we published her story and it won the National Magazine Award for Feature Writing and the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Jen, Scott, and I realized, late in the process, that the story didn’t even have anything resembling a nut graf — a term, borrowed from newspapering, for the paragraph that explains why you, the reader, should continue reading this story. Sometimes a magazine piece is so magnetic that the entire thing is its own nut graf, and this was true in Jen’s case.",
        "I had really started caring about my sentences, and I was worried about the limitations of newspapering. I don’t remember if this was the name of the butcher shop or its marketing slogan or simply a statement of fact, but it doesn’t matter. I learned, over time, that the best magazine editors don’t fear complication but run to it. I’m no great sentence maker, but I wanted — and still want — to try to be one, and I hoped to work for people who wanted me to try. It’s impossible to describe, except to say that it contains all the mess of life and that it is written like poetry but in prose. Self-distancing, of the sort we see to good effect in professional newspaper reporters, has its place.",
        "Our perception of time is anything but constant. Two new studies suggest our heartbeat can cause passing moments to feel either slower or faster. The experiments, led by separate research groups, have uncovered corresponding findings. Together, their work confirms that the heart’s activity influences our perception of time as it passes. They show that we can’t look at the experience of time in isolation from the body.\n\nIn April 2023, a group of neuroscientists led by Irena Arslanova of Royal Holloway, University of London, reported that time perception changes with each heartbeat. In their experiment, 28 people learned to distinguish the duration of two visual or two auditory stimuli. For example, the study participants looked at two shapes or heard two distinct tones. One item or sound from each pair was presented for 200 milliseconds, and the other lasted for 400 milliseconds.\n\nNext, people saw a new cue — another tone or shape — and had to estimate how the presentation felt shorter or longer, using the previous pair for reference. But there was an added twist. These new sounds and shapes were matched with a particular moment in the rhythm of someone’s heart rate: when the heart either contracted (the systole) or relaxed (the diastole) during the heartbeat. During systole, the volunteers perceived time duration to be shorter than it actually was. During diastole, the exact opposite was true.\n\nAccording to Arslanova and her colleagues, the phenomenon may be explained by the fact that pressure sensors in blood vessel walls send signals to the brain and affect its capacity to process incoming information. This increase in sensory impressions could make time feel longer. A similar finding was published in March 2023 by a group of researchers at Cornell University, who focused on differences in time perception between single heartbeats. When that span is longer, they discovered, time feels slower. When there is more time between two beats, time seems to move faster.\n\nResearchers from both groups caution that those experiences are influenced by many factors, including our emotion and attention. They also happen at a totally different scale. As Adam K. Anderson, one of the authors of the March study, explains, however, the new work illuminates how the heart influences the experience of time as it unfolds. He confirms that how the body and brain relate is of growing interest in neuroscience. “People are comfortable with the idea that the brain can influence what the heart does,” he says. But reversing that relationship is novel and really fascinating. “Your brain,” he adds, “might be listening to patterns in your heart to shape something similarly fundamental as the passage of time.”\n\nMy mother had raised me vegetarian, and though I harbored no real desire to eat meat, sometimes, in summer, I would take a large piece of watermelon to a remote corner of our yard and pretend it was a fresh dead animal. On all fours, I would bury my face in the sweet red fruit-meat and bite into it. Sometimes, I’d rip handfuls out and stuff them in my mouth, which wasn’t much like the way any animal I knew of ate. I was less playing a particular kind of animal than enacting a form of wildness that I recognized in myself.\n\nI watched Wild America, a PBS show on which conservationist Marty Stouffer revealed the wildness of the animal world. Alone in the woods behind our house I had beaten my chest, acted out my own invented stories without a thought to how another’s gaze might see me. I sympathized with the restless business of squirrels and wild obsessions of our golden retriever. I was embarrassed by forks and knives — why they should exist when we had such perfect instruments at the ends of our arms.\n\nHowever often Stouffer imposed human narratives on the animals depicted (very often), it was still always clear that survival was the priority that assigned value to everything in the animal world. If the wild marten was overcome by her own feelings, she didn’t let it stop her from getting dinner for her babies. I learned in elementary school that we were animals, but unlike other animals we did not seem driven by the instinct for physical survival. My teachers emphasized the continuity, but we were so far up the food chain that survival was no longer even visible to us. We were beyond survival, in a dark and sky-high realm where our instincts had been twisted into atrocities like capitalism and hair removal. I might not have been able to name this, but I recognized it.",
        "My love for walking started in childhood, out of necessity. I didn’t want to stay at home. I found every reason to stay away from home and was usually out — at some friend’s house or at a street party where no kids should be — until it was too late to get public transportation. So I walked.\n\nThe streets of Kingston, Jamaica, in the 1980s were often terrifying, but I made friends with strangers. The beggar, the vendor, the poor laborer — those were experienced wanderers, and they became my nighttime instructors; they knew the streets and delivered lessons on how to explore and enjoy them. The streets had their own safety: Unlike at home, there I could be myself without fear. Walking became so regular and familiar that the way home became home.\n\nThe streets had their rules, and I loved the challenge of trying to master them. I learned how to be alert to surrounding dangers and nearby delights, and I prided myself on recognizing significant details that my peers missed. Kingston was a map of complex, and often bizarre, cultural and political and social activity, and I appointed myself its nighttime mapmaker.\n\nI left Jamaica in 1996 to attend college in New Orleans, a city I’d heard called “the northernmost Caribbean city.” I wanted to discover — on foot, of course — what was Caribbean and what was American about it.\n\nOn my first day in the city, I went walking for a few hours to get a feel for the place and to buy supplies to transform my dormitory room into a welcoming space. When some university staff members found out what I’d been up to, they advised me to restrict my walking to the places recommended as safe to tourists and the parents of new students. They mentioned statistics about New Orleans’s crime rate. But Kingston’s crime rate far exceeded those numbers, and I decided to ignore these well-meant cautions. A city was waiting to be discovered, and I wouldn’t let inconvenient facts get in the way. These American criminals are nothing compared to Kingston’s, I thought. They’re no real threat to me.\n\nWhat no one prepared me for was who would be considered a threat.\n\nWithin days I noticed that many people on the street seemed afraid of me: Some gave me a glance as they approached, and then crossed the street; others, ahead, would glance behind, notice my presence, and then speed up; older white women clutched their bags; young white men nervously greeted me, as if exchanging a salutation for their safety: “What’s up, bro?” On one occasion, less than a month after my arrival, I tried to help a man whose wheelchair was stuck in the middle of a street; he threatened to shoot me in the face, then asked a white person for help.\n\nI wasn’t prepared for any of this. I had come from a majority-black country in which no one was wary of me because of my skin color. Now I wasn’t sure who was afraid of me. I was especially unprepared for the cops. They regularly stopped and questioned me, asking questions that took my guilt for granted. I'd never received what many of my African American friends call “The Talk”: No parents had told me how to behave when I was stopped by the police, how to be as polite and cooperative as possible, no matter what they said or did to me.\n\nMy survival tactics began. In this city of energetic streets, walking became a complex and often oppressive negotiation. I would see a white woman walking toward me at night and cross the street to reassure her that she was safe. I would forget something at home but not immediately turn around if someone was behind me, because I discovered that a sudden turn could cause alarm. New Orleans suddenly felt more dangerous than Jamaica. Despite my best efforts, the streets never felt comfortably safe. Even a simple salutation was suspect.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina hit the area, my aunt persuaded me to come to stay in New York City. I explored the city with friends, and then with a woman I'd begun dating. She walked around endlessly with me, taking in New York City’s many pleasures. My impressions of the city took shape during my walks with her. But it wasn’t long before reality reminded me I wasn’t safe, especially when I walked alone.\n\nOne night in the East Village, I was running to dinner when a white man in front of me turned and suddenly punched me in the chest. I assumed he was drunk or had mistaken me for an old enemy, but found out soon enough that he’d merely assumed I was a criminal because of my race. When he discovered I wasn’t a threat, he went on to tell me that his assault was my own fault for running up behind him. I returned to the old rules I’d set for myself in New Orleans.\n\nI’m still trying to arrive in a city that isn’t quite mine. One definition of home is that it’s somewhere we can most be ourselves. And when are we more ourselves but when walking, that natural state in which we repeat one of the first actions we learned? A foot leaves, a foot lands, and our longing gives it momentum from rest to rest. We long to look, to think, to talk, to get away. But more than anything else, we long to be free. We want the freedom and pleasure of walking without fear — without others’ fear — wherever we choose. I’ve lived in New York City for almost a decade and have not stopped walking its fascinating streets. And I still long to find the comfort that I found as a kid on the streets of Kingston.",
        "After living in the United States for a while, the author realizes that Kingston, New Orleans, and New York City do not differ much in terms of safety. Being able to walk the streets of a city without fear or concern is a significant source of freedom for the author. For the author, walking is an act of rebellion against racism and the police. Walking in U.S. cities is not a stressful experience for the author because he is used to paying attention to every move he makes on the street. While living in Kingston, the author feels equally comfortable at his childhood home and on the city’s various streets."

        "In 2019 there were 3,800 publicly disclosed data breaches, a significant increase over time. As security officers work to reduce the likelihood of breaches, there is an ongoing concern over the lack of user compliance with information security policies. Informational security policies depend on user compliance to protect computing resources. When users are lax with security measures and fail to follow security related directives, data breaches are more likely to occur. It is possible that users have capitulated and have decided that data breaches are inevitable and therefore their actions will not be effective in preventing data breaches in their organization.\n\nIn business, feelings of capitulation have been described as resulting from a perceived lack of control and autonomy. In psychology, capitulation is considered an end state occurring when individuals realize they cannot change their undesirable reality and do not have control of a detrimental situation. The inverse of this definition can be applied to organizational security; when users feel that they have control over technologies and that they possess greater autonomy, they are much more likely to constructively take part in individual security management and not give up. When users feel they lack control and autonomy and that security controls are centralized, they are inclined to ignore technologies aimed at securing the organization.\n\nOrganizational security has historically been controlled by policy making, placing the burden of security compliance on the end user; however, this has led some security researchers to suggest that the “user is not the enemy.” Authoritarian responses to security produce conflict between the organization’s security interests and end users' security behaviors. The manner in which users deal with these conflicts may include feelings of giving up, disengagement or capitulation. Often capitulation is viewed as a response to difficulty and equated to feelings of helplessness causing a person to fail to engage. Capitulation is defined here as the feeling of giving up or not acting because the behavior would not be productive or successful.\n\nSome research has supported the idea of negative security effects on employees and others report negative reactions based on punishment for information security policy violations which then lead to a reduction in the individual’s intent to comply. When organizations make employees responsible for computer security, they introduce stress into the work environment. These stressors may produce moral disengagement resulting in a lack of concern. Research showed how organizational security expectations can fail due to moral disengagement. Of interest, employees experiencing security overload, complexity and uncertainty may turn to moral disengagement. These diminished security behaviors may be due to the time, effort and frustration employees feel causing employee security requirements to fail. Moral disengagement may lead to an appraisal of commitment to the information security policy. Capitulation may be the result, affecting information security policy non-compliance in organizations. Whether users reduce their efforts, stop trying, take on new pursuits, look for other meaningful behaviors or disengage from complying with information security policies, the end result is a reduction in security.\n\nDistrust is defined as the feeling that someone or something cannot be relied upon. An individual experiencing distrust feels they cannot accept another’s statements or actions at face value. They are suspicious and feel that people are out to deceive them. Distrust has been characterized as having negative expectations, and distrust has been linked to fear, wariness and suspicion. Interestingly, distrust can be associated with a person, place or thing and it can be valuable in preventing exploitation.\n\nTrust and distrust are not the same, although they are often interchanged. As an illustration, trust is created with positive feelings, while distrust is associated with negative feelings; however, it is not the case that high trust levels will lead to lower distrust levels. Distrust can be a positive force because it can lead individuals to be more aware of threat actors.\n\nScrutiny of trust and distrust appears across many disciplines and research settings. Research on recommender agents established the difference between trust building and distrust building agents for information technology. The study results indicated that, within the context of technology applications, actions that build trust levels may not lower distrust levels. In fact, a disposition to distrust is the result of a lifetime of learned experiences. Factors that contribute to distrust are the reputation of the work organization and the individuals, perception of negative aspects of the work environment.\n\nOne interesting study suggested that individuals prone to distrust may avoid established security behaviors because they believe these actions can be anticipated by those seeking to deceive them. In consideration of human nature, it should be noted that, while individuals are predisposed to be trustful or distrustful, this is not an “either or” designation. Specifically, the same individual may be trustful or distrustful depending on the scenario and various factors surrounding the context of that scenario. How these feelings affect whether users comply with information systems security policies and the impact of capitulation is important.",
        "Information systems (IS) security administrators are responsible for keeping their information assets and systems safe from insider crimes’ potential risks. Organizations have adopted two major strategies to prevent employees from committing insider attacks: stimulating employees’ conscience and adopting techniques to reduce the opportunity of committing crimes. IS security administrators have curbed their employees’ motivation for committing insider crimes.\n\nIS security administrators need to eliminate the environmental opportunities that can be considered a crack for insiders’ malicious attempts. According to the rational choice theory, malicious insiders are willing to commit malfeasances only when the expected rewards of malicious behaviors outweigh the anticipated risks or costs. Thus, IS security administrators need to focus on increasing costs and decreasing the anticipated benefits of malicious behaviors. This security policy is less likely to induce malicious insiders to put their plan into action, such as electronic monitoring and surveillance, access control, and installing physical barriers, not solely relying on dealing with the internal motivations of insiders.",
        "However, this approach at the organizational level is inherently coupled with the possibility of infringing on each employee's space. As there will be more restrictions imposed on each individual's actions, it may undermine the trust-based bilateral relationship between employees and employers. Moreover, employees having no choice other than consenting to the organizational policy might be problematic because of a massive bargaining power gap between employees and employers in this bilateral relationship. Despite the seemingly nonexistent problems in procedures, employees have been forced to contract out their privacy rights even with their full awareness of the policy's potential to infringe on their personal spaces. Such a tremendous bargaining power gap may lead employees to have negative reactions, such as computer abuse. These reactions are potential adverse effects on organizational efforts that aim to minimize the opportunity of committing a crime from the perspective of malicious insiders.\n\nPrior research has mainly focused on trust and largely ignored distrust, partly because of the assumption that trust building and distrust building are two ends of one continuum; thus, an IT (information technology) design that increases trust building in the IT will decrease distrust building at the same time. However, this assumption may not be true if trust-building and distrust-building processes in the context of IT usage are actually two separate and different processes. For example, a customer can use a web-based product recommendation agent (RA) to get personalized advice on which products to buy, based on his or her personal needs. Online customers have to trust an RA before complying with its advice. In our protocol analysis study, an RA explained a product feature (computer screen) in detail using technical language. We observed that some users trusted this RA because its explanation was detailed and professional. But this RA’s explanation feature does not necessarily automatically reduce distrust at the same time. Other users may not fully understand the technical explanation provided and their confusion about the RA’s explanation may lead them to distrust the RA’s competence and integrity. In another example, a finance website takes a while to download its contents. The downloading time may lead one customer to distrust the technical competence of the website because she does not know why she needs to wait so long. The same downloading time may lead to trust in the website if another customer believes the wait is due to many graphs and figures with valuable up-to-the-minute stock market information. Therefore, it is important to understand, through the collection of empirical evidence, the actual processes of trust building and distrust building, i.e., how users interpret an IT’s features to form their trusting/distrusting beliefs.",
        "Different individuals but not the same individual may be trusting or distrusting depending on the context in which a decision is made. Recommender agents build trust among individuals with varied backgrounds regardless of the context in which a decision is made. Recommender agents lessen distrust for individuals with varied backgrounds in all contexts in which a decision is made.\n\nUsers who lack understanding and autonomy when interacting with technology may experience which of the following? From the point of view of strict logic, a rigorous course on analysis should precede a course on calculus. Strict logic is, however, overruled by both history and practicality. Historically, calculus, with its origins in the 17th century, came first, and made rapid progress on the basis of informal intuition. Not until well through the 19th century was the theory constructed on sound logical foundations. As for practicality, every university teacher knows that students are not ready for even a semi-rigorous course on analysis until they have acquired the intuitions and skills that come from a traditional calculus course. Analysis, I have always thought, is the pons asinorum (the bridge of asses, that is, a critical test of ability that separates the clever from the foolish) of modern mathematics. This shows, I suppose, how much progress we have made in two thousand years, for it is a great deal more sophisticated than the Theorem of Pythagoras, which once received that title. All who have taught the subject know how patient one has to be, for the ideas take root gradually, even in students of good ability. This is not too surprising, since it took more than two centuries for calculus to evolve into what we now call analysis, and even a gifted student, guided by an expert teacher, cannot be expected to grasp all of the issues immediately. I have not set out to do anything very original, since in a field as well-established as analysis, originality too easily becomes eccentricity. Although it is important to demonstrate the limitations of a visual, intuitive approach by means of some “strange” examples of functions, too much emphasis on “pathology” gives altogether the wrong impression of what analysis is. I hope I have avoided that error.",
        "Suppose you've started an online furniture store that specializes in various types of sofas. Some are attractive to customers because of their comfort and others because of price. Is there anything you can think to do that would incline visitors to your website to focus on the feature of comfort and, consequently, to prefer to make a sofa purchase that prioritized it over cost? You’ve no need to labor long for an answer, because two marketing professors, Naomi Mandel and Eric Johnson, have provided insight in a set of studies using just such an online furniture site. When Mandel began the research project in the late 1990s, the impact of virtual stores such as Amazon and eBay was only beginning to emerge. But how to optimize success within this form of exchange had not been addressed systematically.\n\nIn an article largely overlooked since it was published in 2002, they described how they were able to draw website visitors’ attention to the goal of comfort merely by placing fluffy clouds on the background wallpaper of the site’s landing page. This maneuver led those visitors to assign elevated levels of importance to comfort when asked what they were looking for in a sofa.\n\nFor example, in an intervention using young non-gamer adults, we found that 2 weeks of playing Super Mario 3D World improved hippocampal-based memory performance relative to both active and no-contact control groups, with the amount of exploration in the game correlating with the amount of improvement.\n\nIn this study, 2 weeks of spatial exploration of the virtual world and building complex structures with resources gathered in the world resulted in a robust improvement in memory ability.\n\nPrior research in our lab and others has demonstrated positive effects of large, immersive 3D video game playing on hippocampal-based memory ability.\n\nIn yet another study, we used Minecraft to more directly manipulate the amount and type of enrichment.\n\nWe found a similar effect in older adults (60-80 years) with 4 weeks of playing improving memory ability such that it matched performance of participants 15-20 years younger.\n\nOne clear aspect of many modern video games is that they provide a novel, rich world to explore. Decades of neuroscience research dating back to pioneering efforts by Donald Hebb have shown that simply placing laboratory animals in enriched environments improves cognitive performance within a wide range of underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nThus, there is substantial neurobiological evidence to support the idea that environmental enrichment, even from video games, might have a positive effect on the hippocampus and the memory abilities it supports.\n\nVideo games and Esports do not always enjoy a positive view in our society, despite the popularity of video games and the rising impact of Esports. Yet, at their core, modern video games often provide incredibly rich cognitive experiences, opportunities for problem solving, for competition, for teamwork, and for social interaction. As a result, gaming and Esports have the potential to provide considerable positive effects to the brain.\n\nThis “environmental enrichment” can not only ameliorate age-related effects on memory and structures in the brain like the hippocampus, known to support memory, but it has been shown to reduce the presence of both the amyloid-beta plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles in mouse models of Alzheimer’s Disease, rescue deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, improve hippocampal-based memory, and up-regulate neurotrophic factors important to environmental enrichment.",

        "Ignatius Loyola, a nobleman, soldier, and later a priest, at the beginning of his only book, Spiritual Exercises, proposed a ground rule, termed the presupponendum. It reads: “Every good Christian ought to be more eager to put a good interpretation on a neighbour’s statement than to condemn it. Further, if one cannot interpret it favourably, one should ask how the other means it. If that meaning is wrong, one should correct the person with charity; and if this is not enough, one should search out every appropriate means through which, by understanding the statement in a good way, it may be saved.” Obviously, Ignatius wrote it for Christians, and only in a specific context. However, we will try to show that this may serve as an inspiration for creating a procedure which preserves all the insights leading to the principle of charity while allowing us to learn from encounters with different epistemic perspectives and substantially improving one’s own worldview.\n\nWithin Ignatius’ rule we may distinguish four steps, which in fact amount to a procedure of “presupposing,” which will be very useful for modelling a dialectical principle of charity.\n\nConsider the following definitions of two types of arguments.\n\nStraw man argument — An argument that is formulated by a debater as a very weak form of their opponent’s argument, often done by misrepresenting their opponent’s argument so that it can be easily knocked down.\n\nSteel man argument — A reformulation of an opponent’s argument into the strongest argument possible based on what the opponent has said; often used to make the argument more intellectually challenging.",
        "memory. Unfortunately, working memory is highly limited. We can hold only three or four new items in working memory at any one time. This places a huge limit on our ability to solve problems. You can see this by increasing the length of a range of multiplication problems. If you are asked to solve the problem mentally, then it is possible for you to succeed, because doing so does not require you to hold new information in your working memory at once. But there is still a chance you will make errors, because you do have to use your working memory to remember a few things. You can solve this problem several ways; the following is probably the most common: Put 2 down, carry 4.\n\nAdd 4 to 28=32.\n\nRemember you had put 2 down.\n\nThus, the final answer is.\n\nWhatever method you use to calculate this, you have to hold one piece of information in your working memory while you work out the next piece. Then you have to recall the first piece of information because you need to do something that involves using it and the second piece together. It is typical when solving problems like this to forget the result of the first calculation by the time you have got to the end of the last calculation. Multiplying a three-digit number by a one-digit number would test working memory even further.\n\nAnd if you are asked to solve the problem mentally, you almost certainly will not succeed. It is not that you do not know how to solve the problem; it is that solving it involves you holding far too many new pieces of information in your working memory at once.",
        "Because of the huge commitment involved, nobody wanted to oversee or manage the organization’s annual fundraising drive. The experimental findings suggested that a long-accepted theory was in doubt and needed re-examination. The executive was implicated in the scheme to avoid paying taxes by offshoring company income. We were devastated to learn that our pet had late stage cancer and would probably not live more than a few more weeks. Due to the stormy weather, the ferry reached the station over two hours late. The setting for the opening scene of the film is a university graduation ceremony in the mid-20th century. After you open your browser, you'll need to change certain settings in order to make it run more securely. While many in the public cast strong suspicions on them, the board of trustees showed integrity in their honest dealings with the matter. The waves buffeted the ship during the heavy storm, but its structural integrity held and it completed its journey safely."
