      "In the mid-1990s my wife served as the United Nations human rights officer in Liberia. At the time, I had just started writing for the magazine New York, and my editor did not have the Liberian civil war high on his list of most urgent topics. But I was lucky — my editor was understanding enough to let me write about the war for The New York Times Magazine, my first legitimate foreign assignment.\n\nEverything about the Liberian civil war was unusual and terrible and fascinating. I was especially taken, though, by the Liberian press — a group of reporters, editors, and photographers who were aggressive, clever, and determined. There was not enough food in Monrovia, no clean water, barely any electricity, yet the press somehow found enough ink and paper to produce some astonishing journalism.\n\nThe strange thing is that, after all this time, it is an advertisement from these Liberian papers that I remember most clearly. It was an ad that helped me understand — in a real lightning strike of understanding — the best way to approach magazine writing and editing, which I was just then learning.\n\nThe ad was for a local butcher shop and read “All Parts of the Cow.” “All Parts of the Cow” has stayed with me for almost thirty years because it became the way I explain the difference between newspaper writing and magazine writing.\n\nLike many magazine people, I started in newspapers, and I loved the work: the adrenaline, the urgency, the high-pressure collaboration. When I was a novice reporter on the night police beat at The Washington Post, I once left the newsroom at four a.m., wandered to the basement pressroom, and grabbed an actually hot-off-the-presses copy of the morning’s paper, one with my signed article on the front page. At the bottom, but never mind. It still felt great.\n\nWhat I’m about to say is not meant to be a criticism of newspapers or newspaper people. Obviously, newspapers, especially the big national papers, are stuffed with creative, brave, and talented people who are also, by the way, helping to save our democracy, which is no small thing.\n\nThe problem I had was twofold: First was the amount of clichés. On the police desk, we joked that the city had only two types of streets: “quiet, tree-lined streets” or “trash-scattered, drug-plagued streets.” I once made a joke about it, but he didn’t have time to get the joke.\n\nCliché is everywhere, especially in writing. Clichés are one of the prices we pay in journalism for speed, but alertness and a brisk pre-edit scrub will eliminate most of them.\n\nThe second problem: In newspaper editing it is common to remove wild feeling, weird detail, irregular observation, and the disturbing dynamics of writers interacting with their subjects and the world. A smart New Yorker editor, the late John Bennet, once told me that the real bias in journalism is toward consistency, and though there are other biases — of course — this seemed undoubtedly true. This unexamined bias causes us to think that stories have beginnings, middles and endings, that all questions must be answered, and that everything that happens in the universe happens for a reason.\n\nMagazine people, generally speaking, have a different understanding: Not every story has an ending; not every story even has a beginning. Not everything has to make sense. Not everything is knowable. And most importantly, something that always and forever adds confusion and complexity to story making: The presence of writers (and their experiences, beliefs, personalities, histories, and dispositions) inevitably changes the reality of whatever the writers are observing and describing. “Put it in, put it all in,” is an efficient way to describe this style of editing. Another way to describe it: “All parts of the cow.”\n\nLast year, when I asked Jennifer Senior, who had just joined the staff of The Atlantic, if she had anything original to say about the twentieth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (originality traditionally being scarce on anniversaries of world-historical events), she thought for a minute and then said, “Maybe, but it’s complicated.” The story she sketched for me then was something more than complicated. It was exquisitely personal, and it featured — of all people — a 9/11 truther, “A good man,” Jen said, something never previously said by sane people about 9/11 truthers. We talked and talked and talked. And then I thought, “All parts of the cow,” and I said, “Let’s try it.” Just put it all in. And then Jen and her editor, Scott Stossel, made something magical happen, and we published her story and it won the National Magazine Award for Feature Writing and the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Jen, Scott, and I realized, late in the process, that the story didn’t even have anything resembling a nut graf — a term, borrowed from newspapering, for the paragraph that explains why you, the reader, should continue reading this story. Sometimes a magazine piece is so magnetic that the entire thing is its own nut graf, and this was true in Jen’s case.",
      "by then, though, I had really started caring about my sentences, and I was worried about the limitations of newspapering. I don’t remember if this was the name of the butcher shop or its marketing slogan or simply a statement of fact, but it doesn’t matter. I learned, over time, that the best magazine editors don’t fear complication but run to it. I’m no great sentence maker, but I wanted — and still want — to try to be one, and I hoped to work for people who wanted me to try. it’s impossible to describe, except to say that it contains all the mess of life and that it is written like poetry but in prose. self-distancing, of the sort we see to good effect in professional newspaper reporters, has its place.",
      "Our perception of time is anything but constant. Two new studies suggest our heartbeat can cause passing moments to feel either slower or faster. The experiments, led by separate research groups, have uncovered corresponding findings. Together, their work confirms that the heart’s activity influences our perception of time as it passes. They show that we can’t look at the experience of time in isolation from the body.\n\nIn April 2023, a group of neuroscientists led by Irena Arslanova of Royal Holloway, University of London, reported that time perception changes with each heartbeat. In their experiment, 28 people learned to distinguish the duration of two visual or two auditory stimuli. For example, the study participants looked at two shapes or heard two distinct tones. One item or sound from each pair was presented for 200 milliseconds, and the other lasted for 400 milliseconds.\n\nNext, people saw a new cue — another tone or shape — and had to estimate how the presentation felt shorter or longer, using the previous pair for reference. But there was an added twist. These new sounds and shapes were matched with a particular moment in the rhythm of someone’s heart rate: when the heart either contracted (the systole) or relaxed (the diastole) during the heartbeat. During systole, the volunteers perceived time duration to be shorter than it actually was. During diastole, the exact opposite was true.\n\nAccording to Arslanova and her colleagues, the phenomenon may be explained by the fact that pressure sensors in blood vessel walls send signals to the brain and affect its capacity to process incoming information. This increase in sensory impressions could make time feel longer. A similar finding was published in March 2023 by a group of researchers at Cornell University, who focused on differences in time perception between single heartbeats. When that span is longer, they discovered, time feels slower. When there is more time between two beats, time seems to move faster.\n\nResearchers from both groups caution that those experiences are influenced by many factors, including our emotion and attention. They also happen at a totally different scale. As Adam K. Anderson, one of the authors of the March study, explains, however, the new work illuminates how the heart influences the experience of time as it unfolds. He confirms that how the body and brain relate is of growing interest in neuroscience. “People are comfortable with the idea that the brain can influence what the heart does,” he says. But reversing that relationship is novel and really fascinating. “Your brain,” he adds, “might be listening to patterns in your heart to shape something similarly fundamental as the passage of time.”\n\nMy mother had raised me vegetarian, and though I harbored no real desire to eat meat, sometimes, in summer, I would take a large piece of watermelon to a remote corner of our yard and pretend it was a fresh dead animal. On all fours, I would bury my face in the sweet red fruit-meat and bite into it. Sometimes, I’d rip handfuls out and stuff them in my mouth, which wasn’t much like the way any animal I knew of ate. I was less playing a particular kind of animal than enacting a form of wildness that I recognized in myself.\n\nI watched Wild America, a PBS show on which conservationist Marty Stouffer revealed the wildness of the animal world. Alone in the woods behind our house I had beaten my chest, acted out my own invented stories without a thought to how another’s gaze might see me. I sympathized with the restless business of squirrels and wild obsessions of our golden retriever. I was embarrassed by forks and knives — why they should exist when we had such perfect instruments at the ends of our arms.\n\nHowever often Stouffer imposed human narratives on the animals depicted (very often), it was still always clear that survival was the priority that assigned value to everything in the animal world. If the wild marten was overcome by her own feelings, she didn’t let it stop her from getting dinner for her babies. I learned in elementary school that we were animals, but unlike other animals we did not seem driven by the instinct for physical survival. My teachers emphasized the continuity, but we were so far up the food chain that survival was no longer even visible to us. We were beyond survival, in a dark and sky-high realm where our instincts had been twisted into atrocities like capitalism and hair removal. I might not have been able to name this, but I recognized it.",
      "My love for walking started in childhood, out of necessity. I didn’t want to stay at home. I found every reason to stay away from home and was usually out — at some friend’s house or at a street party where no kids should be — until it was too late to get public transportation. So I walked.\n\nThe streets of Kingston, Jamaica, in the 1980s were often terrifying, but I made friends with strangers. The beggar, the vendor, the poor laborer — those were experienced wanderers, and they became my nighttime instructors; they knew the streets and delivered lessons on how to explore and enjoy them. The streets had their own safety: Unlike at home, there I could be myself without fear. Walking became so regular and familiar that the way home became home.\n\nThe streets had their rules, and I loved the challenge of trying to master them. I learned how to be alert to surrounding dangers and nearby delights, and I prided myself on recognizing significant details that my peers missed. Kingston was a map of complex, and often bizarre, cultural and political and social activity, and I appointed myself its nighttime mapmaker.\n\nI left Jamaica in 1996 to attend college in New Orleans, a city I’d heard called “the northernmost Caribbean city.” I wanted to discover — on foot, of course — what was Caribbean and what was American about it.\n\nOn my first day in the city, I went walking for a few hours to get a feel for the place and to buy supplies to transform my dormitory room into a welcoming space. When some university staff members found out what I’d been up to, they advised me to restrict my walking to the places recommended as safe to tourists and the parents of new students. They mentioned statistics about New Orleans’s crime rate. But Kingston’s crime rate far exceeded those numbers, and I decided to ignore these well-meant cautions. A city was waiting to be discovered, and I wouldn’t let inconvenient facts get in the way. These American criminals are nothing compared to Kingston’s, I thought. They’re no real threat to me.\n\nWhat no one prepared me for was who would be considered a threat.\n\nWithin days I noticed that many people on the street seemed afraid of me: Some gave me a glance as they approached, and then crossed the street; others, ahead, would glance behind, notice my presence, and then speed up; older white women clutched their bags; young white men nervously greeted me, as if exchanging a salutation for their safety: “What’s up, bro?” On one occasion, less than a month after my arrival, I tried to help a man whose wheelchair was stuck in the middle of a street; he threatened to shoot me in the face, then asked a white person for help.\n\nI wasn’t prepared for any of this. I had come from a majority-black country in which no one was wary of me because of my skin color. Now I wasn’t sure who was afraid of me. I was especially unprepared for the cops. They regularly stopped and questioned me, asking questions that took my guilt for granted. I'd never received what many of my African American friends call “The Talk”: No parents had told me how to behave when I was stopped by the police, how to be as polite and cooperative as possible, no matter what they said or did to me.\n\nMy survival tactics began. In this city of energetic streets, walking became a complex and often oppressive negotiation. I would see a white woman walking toward me at night and cross the street to reassure her that she was safe. I would forget something at home but not immediately turn around if someone was behind me, because I discovered that a sudden turn could cause alarm. New Orleans suddenly felt more dangerous than Jamaica. Despite my best efforts, the streets never felt comfortably safe. Even a simple salutation was suspect.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina hit the area, my aunt persuaded me to come to stay in New York City. I explored the city with friends, and then with a woman I'd begun dating. She walked around endlessly with me, taking in New York City’s many pleasures. My impressions of the city took shape during my walks with her. But it wasn’t long before reality reminded me I wasn’t safe, especially when I walked alone.\n\nOne night in the East Village, I was running to dinner when a white man in front of me turned and suddenly punched me in the chest. I assumed he was drunk or had mistaken me for an old enemy, but found out soon enough that he’d merely assumed I was a criminal because of my race. When he discovered I wasn’t a threat, he went on to tell me that his assault was my own fault for running up behind him. I returned to the old rules I’d set for myself in New Orleans.\n\nI’m still trying to arrive in a city that isn’t quite mine. One definition of home is that it’s somewhere we can most be ourselves. And when are we more ourselves but when walking, that natural state in which we repeat one of the first actions we learned? A foot leaves, a foot lands, and our longing gives it momentum from rest to rest. We long to look, to think, to talk, to get away. But more than anything else, we long to be free. We want the freedom and pleasure of walking without fear — without others’ fear — wherever we choose. I’ve lived in New York City for almost a decade and have not stopped walking its fascinating streets. And I still long to find the comfort that I found as a kid on the streets of Kingston.",
      "After living in the United States for a while, the author realizes that Kingston, New Orleans, and New York City do not differ much in terms of safety. Being able to walk the streets of a city without fear or concern is a significant source of freedom for the author. For the author, walking is an act of rebellion against racism and the police. Walking in U.S. cities is not a stressful experience for the author because he is used to paying attention to every move he makes on the street. While living in Kingston, the author feels equally comfortable at his childhood home and on the city’s various streets."
