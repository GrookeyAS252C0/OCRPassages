      "Nearly four hundred years ago, when modern science was just beginning, Francis Bacon wrote that knowledge is power. Yet Bacon was not a scientist. He wrote as a bureaucrat in retirement. His slogan was actually the first clear statement of the promise by which, ever since, bureaucrats justify to each other and to king or taxpayer the spending of money on science. Knowledge is power; today we would say, less grandly, that science is essential to technology. Bacon’s promise has been fulfilled abundantly, magnificently. The rage to know has been matched by the rage to make. Therefore — with the provision, abundantly demonstrated, that it’s rarely possible to predict which program of fundamental research will produce just what technology and when — the promise has brought scientists in the Western world unprecedented freedom of inquiry. Nonetheless, Bacon’s promise hardly penetrates to the thing that moves most scientists. Science has several rewards, but the greatest is that it is the most interesting, difficult, pitiless, exciting, and beautiful pursuit that we have yet found. Science is our century’s art.\n\nThe takeover can be dated more precisely than the beginning of most eras: Friday, June 30, 1905, will do, when Albert Einstein, a clerk in the Swiss patent office in Bern, submitted a thirty-one-page paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” to the journal Annalen der Physik. No poem, no play, no piece of music written since then comes near the theory of relativity in its power, as one strains to apprehend it, to make the mind tremble with delight. Whereas fifty years ago it was often said that hardly twoscore people understood the theory of relativity, today its essential vision, as Einstein himself said, is within reach of any reasonably bright high school student — and that, too, is characteristic of the speed of assimilation of the new in the arts.\n\nConsider also the molecular structure of that stuff of the gene, the celebrated double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This is two repetitive strands, one winding up, the other down, but hooked together, across the tube of space between them, by a sequence of pairs of chemical entities — just four sorts of these entities, making just two kinds of pairs, with exactly ten pairs to a full turn of the helix. It’s a piece of sculpture. But observe how form and function are one. That sequence possesses a unique duality: one way, it allows the strands to part and each to assemble on itself, by the pairing rules, a duplicate of the complementary strand; the other way, the sequence encodes, in a four-letter alphabet, the entire specification for the substance of the organism. The structure thus encompasses both heredity and embryological growth, the passing-on of potential and its expression. The structure’s elucidation, in March of 1953, was an event of such surpassing explanatory power that it will reverberate through whatever time mankind has remaining. The structure is also perfectly economical and splendidly elegant. There is no sculpture made in this century that is so entrancing.\n\nIf to compare science to art seems — in the last quarter of this century — to undervalue what science does, that must be, at least partly, because we now expect art to do so little. Before our century, everyone of course supposed that the artist imitates nature. Aristotle had said so; the idea was obvious, it had flourished and evolved for two thousand years; those who thought about it added that the artist imitated not just nature as it accidentally happens, but by penetrating to nature as it has to be. Yet today that describes the scientist. “Scientific reasoning,” Medawar also said, “is a constant interplay or interaction between hypotheses and the logical expectations they give rise to: there is a restless to-and-fro motion of thought, the formulation and reformulation of hypotheses, until we arrive at a hypothesis which, to the best of our prevailing knowledge, will satisfactorily meet the case.” Thus far, change only the term “hypothesis” and Medawar described well the experience the painter or the poet has of his own work. “Scientific reasoning is a kind of dialogue between the possible and the actual, between what might be and what is in fact the case,” he went on — and there the difference lies. The scientist enjoys the harsher discipline of what is and is not the case. It is he, rather than the painter or the poet, who pursues in its stringent form the imitation of nature.\n\nMany scientists — mathematicians and physicists especially — hold that beauty in a theory is itself almost a form of proof. They speak, for example, of “elegance.” Paul Dirac predicted the existence of antimatter several years before any form of it was observed. He won a share in the Nobel Prize in physics in 1933 for the work that included that prediction. “It is more important to have beauty in one’s equations than to have them fit experiment,” Dirac wrote many years later. “It seems that if one is working from the point of view of getting beauty in one’s equations, and if one has really a sound insight, one is on a sure line of progress.” Here the scientist parts company with the artist. The insight must be sound. The dialogue is between what might be and what is in fact the case. The scientist is trying to get the thing right. The world is there.",
      "the bench or the blackboard, and on to formal publication — which is a formal invitation to criticism. The most fundamental function of the social system of science is to enlarge the interplay between imagination and judgment from a private into a public activity. The oceanic feeling of well-being, the true touchstone of the artist, is for the scientist, even the most fortunate and gifted, only the midpoint of the process of doing science.",
      "I first came to know Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar a quarter of a century ago through his gifted wife, Lalitha, who had been a student in adult liberal education seminars I have conducted at the University of Chicago for some forty years. He and I would talk from time to time, usually for a few minutes during the tea hour before the Thursday Physics Seminar on the University campus.\n\nIt was this relationship, marginal though it obviously was for him in an eventful life, that led to my being invited by Andrew Patner to join a professional physicist (Robert Wald) for a tribute to Professor Chandrasekhar broadcast by our local National Public Radio station on August 28, 1995. It was instructive to attempt to prepare myself properly for that assignment. I read a number of things by and about Mr. Chandrasekhar, including materials he had sent me over the years.\n\nParticularly revealing were the Chandrasekhar papers in the University of Chicago Archives, which include handwritten manuscripts that are remarkably orderly. One can get a sense of the beneficial discipline to which an unusually intelligent and sensitive child had been subjected to by his tutors in India some eighty years ago. One can also get a sense of how limited one’s own work is by comparison. The respect I had for Mr. Chandrasekhar was reinforced by the conversations I had, during the week before our broadcast, with a number of his scientific colleagues on the Chicago campus and elsewhere. Their ranking of him, as not far below Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi, seemed both informed and sincere.\n\nPerhaps most noteworthy for Mr. Chandrasekhar’s fellow scientists was his ability to turn his attention every decade or so to a new field, usually a neglected field in astrophysics or physics, which he would study intensely and make his own, endowing his colleagues with a significant book on the subject. Critical to his ability to do this were his skills as a mathematician. Although the Nobel Prize awarded to him in 1983 emphasized his work done a half-century before (that led eventually to astonishing and, in a sense, still unbelievable, “black holes” conjectures), it was his entire body of work which was recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee.\n\nAlthough most physicists are hardly likely to make much of it, the last project to which Mr. Chandrasekhar devoted himself wholeheartedly was an extended interpretation of those parts of Newton’s Principia that seemed in the direct line leading to Newton’s formulation of his universal law of gravitation. This culminated in his publication of a handsome volume on that subject not long before he died: Newton’s Principia for the Common Reader. The character of this book reflects splendidly the character of the meticulous man that we had often seen stroll the sidewalks of Hyde Park in the evenings with his charming wife.\n\nMy preparation for our radio broadcast included laboring through the Chandrasekhar book on the Principia in which he provides for many of Newton’s propositions the kind of proofs that modern physicists prefer. I had not realized, before talking to various distinguished scientists about these matters, how ill-equipped they consider themselves to be for reading Newton, something that they are not inclined to do anyway. Mr. Chandrasekhar has provided them a “translation” of Newton, enhancing it with comments of his own, many of which testify to his awe upon delving deeper and deeper into the Principia. His honoring of Newton in this fashion does honor to himself in turn.\n\nThe “progressive” character of modern science is reflected in the inaccessibility of Newton for practicing scientists today, however much they accept and build upon his discoveries. The isolation of modern science — a perhaps ominous isolation — is suggested by what has happened to the scientific literacy of the educated layman. In 1800 the educated layman could hope to understand some of Newton, working from his text. Two hundred years later, the educated layman can get little, if anything, from the ever-more-technical studies of nature by the most influential men of science of his own time.\n\nSomehow or other, Newton and his readers for a century thereafter could make more use than can their counterparts today of the natural human understanding of things. The geometrical mode of demonstration employed by Newton seems closer to natural things — and thus defers more to the bodily aspects of things — than the algebraic (and hence ever more “abstract” and inventive) mode employed by his successors today, however much Galileo, Newton and their colleagues tried to distance themselves from Aristotle and his truly natural understanding. The contemporary, somewhat depressed, status of nature among educated folk these days does not seem to be sufficiently noticed, even though a proper grasp of nature is the basis not only of truly reliable science but also of an enduring morality among us. The modern physicist tends to be oblivious to the somewhat unintended effects of our science and its technology upon old-fashioned (if not genuine) philosophy as well as upon ordinary morality. Here, as elsewhere, we can notice the tension between the natural quest for truth, on the one hand, and the perhaps natural pursuit of justice and the common good, on the other.\n\nEven so, Mr. Chandrasekhar’s pioneering effort — perhaps the most serious reading of the Principia by a first-rate scientist in this century — should encourage a professional physicist here and there to",
      "begin thinking about the price in genuine understanding that has been paid in order to secure the undoubted marvels of modern science and its attendant technology. Something more of the man, and of modern science, is suggested by a conversation that I had with Mr. Chandrasekhar in the Physics Common Room before a department seminar in April 1993. He remarked upon the fact that I was still attending the weekly seminar. I responded that it was like my going regularly to Orchestra Hall. He suggested that I overestimated the music I could hear at a seminar. It is not that I understand much of what I hear at either place, I explained, but I cannot help but admire the imagination, the competence, and the devotion I can observe in both places and occasionally I do get a glimpse of the wonderful things on display, all of which is quite instructive as well as edifying. I did not need to add what should be obvious to anyone who knows me: there is much that I have yet to learn about both music and physics.\n\nI then asked Mr. Chandrasekhar, “I hear you are studying Newton these days. Are you finding him as interesting as you had hoped he would be?” He replied that somebody else who had heard he was studying Newton had recently asked him, “How do you feel?” And (Mr. Chandrasekhar continued) he had answered, “I am like a small boy going to the zoo for the first time and seeing a lion.” There was, of course, something of the magisterial lion in Mr. Chandrasekhar as well, which encourages me to make this further observation about him. It chanced that my wife and I, upon returning home from an evening stroll on what proved to be the day of his death, noticed a very bright light in the sky. So striking was it that I called out of his house a neighbor who is on the astronomy faculty of the University of Chicago. He identified the light as Jupiter. It seemed fitting to me, upon learning the following morning of Professor Chandrasekhar’s death, that this majestic heavenly display should have appeared to the southwest of our house, which is where he had lived.",
      "The comprehensibility of science is much easier and common today than it was in Newton’s time. The incomprehensibility of the early days of science is the opposite situation to that of modern times. Scientific illiteracy should not be a concern to modern times because we now have computers to fill in the gaps. Literacy of the general lay population has always been adequate and is in fact one of the main reasons science has brought so many benefits to humankind."
