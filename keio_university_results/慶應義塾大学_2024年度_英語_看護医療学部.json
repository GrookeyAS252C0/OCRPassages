      "I need to schedule an appointment with my dentist. I have been tired lately, so I think I need to get more sleep. Saiko Lake in Yamanashi Prefecture is at the foot of Mt. Fuji. I need further information before I choose a university. You have been practicing outside all day; you must be exhausted. My nephew has studied at university for one semester so far. I'm so glad that I have finished shutting down my computer before the electricity went out. The teacher asked the class to work in pairs on the assignment. The Wild Flamingos concert was sold out within minutes of the tickets being released. Despite the rain, the outdoor concert continued as planned. I need to buy new clothes because my old ones are worn out. I have been working on this project for weeks, and I’m almost done with it. The movie was so scary that I couldn’t sleep that night. I can’t decide between these two options. They both seem appealing. I love that café’s coffee. I go there every day. When is the weather going to change? Yesterday it rained all day! I stopped eating white rice. It’s just empty calories. When you finish the assignment, you will leave. A good student always hands in her homework on time. Plug the USB cable into the computer.",
      "I am a chronically late person. I am not proud of this. It is a flaw in my character and, I am certain many of you reading will agree, a significant one. Some people don’t seem to mind tardiness. I am lucky to know quite a few such people. Others understandably find chronic lateness the height of rudeness and that an individual values their own time more than that of everyone else.\n\nMy main issue is that I am easily distracted. I am somewhat childlike in my facility to have my attention captured by, well, literally anything. Most people grow out of this, but I seem to have grown further into it. A diagnosis of ADHD, long suggested by colleagues, has finally been confirmed by a psychiatrist.\n\nAlso, I sometimes find it difficult to gear myself up to leave the house and feel deeply that my presence will only ruin any social event. So sometimes there are genuine reasons. Although I feel citing the studies that suggest lateness is associated with intelligence might be going too far, I think, with me, it has something to do with insecurity.\n\nIt is a contented bliss, then, to be early. Habitual early birds probably will not experience that high. But I have a theory that one of the purest forms of happiness is relief. Relief has a lightness that unlocks carefreeness, which speaks to freedom, and freedom is happiness.\n\nThe extreme tension I feel when rushed and late, despite it being self-inflicted and a social form of self-harm, means that when I do manage to be on time, or, even better, early, it’s a felicity to savour. As an individual who will sometimes forget keys or even a paperback, any unexpected portion of time for reading is exciting. Reading also offers the opportunity for observation; seeing the things one misses when flitting between modes of public transport and walking fast. Or I’ll just think about who I am meeting and how pleasing it will be to spend time with them. Therefore, it will take a little more time for earliness to stick.",
      "Becky Richards was part of a special team tasked with developing ways to save lives by fixing the medication-error problem at a hospital in San Francisco. As a registered nurse, Richards knew many of the mistakes occurred when people made human errors that were often a result of a work environment filled with distracting external triggers. In fact, studies found nurses experienced five to ten interruptions each time they dispensed medication.\n\nOne of Richards’ solutions did not go over particularly well with her nursing colleagues, at least at first. She proposed nurses wear brightly colored vests to let others know they were dispensing medication and should not be interrupted. After initial resistance, she found one group of nurses in an oncology unit whose error rate was particularly high and who were desperate for a solution.\n\nFor one, the orange vests looked silly, and some complained they were uncomfortably hot. However, despite these nurses’ initial willingness, the test was met with more objections than Richards anticipated. They also brought interruptions from doctors who wanted to know what the vests were about. “We were really thinking about abandoning the whole idea, because the nurses did not like it,” Richards said.\n\nIt wasn't until the hospital administration provided Richards with the results of her experiment four months later that the impact of the trial became clear. The unit recruited for Richards’ experiment saw a 47 percent drop in errors, all thanks to nothing more than wearing the vests and learning about the importance of an interruption-free environment.",
      "Representing 149 countries, diplomats to the United Nations in New York City were immune from having to pay parking tickets until November 2002: they could park anywhere and even block driveways without having to pay fines. The effect of this immunity was big: between November 1997 and the end of 2002, UN diplomatic missions accumulated over 150,000 unpaid parking tickets totaling about $18 million in fines.\n\nThis situation created a natural experiment for two economists, Ted Miguel and Ray Fisman. Because nearly 90 percent of UN missions are within one mile of the UN complex, most diplomats faced the same crowded streets, rainy days, and snowy weather. This allowed Ted and Ray to compare the accumulation of parking tickets for diplomats from different countries.\n\nThe differences were big. During the five years leading up to the end of immunity in 2002, diplomats from the UK, Sweden, Canada, Australia, and a few other countries got a total of zero tickets. Meanwhile, diplomats from Egypt, Chad, and Bulgaria, among other countries, got the most tickets, accumulating over 100 for each member of their respective diplomatic delegations. Looking across nations, the higher the international corruption index for a delegation’s home country, the more tickets those delegations accumulated. The relationship between corruption back home and parking behavior in Manhattan holds independent of the size of a country’s UN mission, the income of its diplomats, the type of violation, and the time of day.\n\nIn 2002, diplomatic immunity for parking violations ended and the New York Police Department clamped down, stripping the diplomatic license plates from vehicles that had accumulated more than three parking violations. The rate of violations among diplomats plummeted. Nevertheless, despite the new enforcement and overall much higher violation rates, the diplomats from the most corrupt countries still got the most parking tickets.\n\nBased on real-world data, this study suggests that the delegations from diverse countries brought certain psychological tendencies or motivations with them from home that manifested in their parking behavior, especially when there was a real threat of external sanctions.",
      "My best friend from childhood, Sarah, is a pediatrician, and she is both practical and kind. We were talking about my face one day. “It’s not a tragedy,” she said, “but it must be disappointing.” I suppose this helpful distinction between the disappointing and the tragic sheds light on why I resisted writing about Bell’s palsy for such a long time. Disappointing things were not for the written word, disappointing things were for the stiff upper lip. Tragic things are for the written word, because in tragedy there is catharsis, not slow, almost invisible progress.\n\nThe partial recovery is not terribly dramatic. It is the stuff of life, not art. But the partial recovery is very much like life. A childhood burn, a childhood trauma, a broken bone, a broken heart... How rare is it for someone to hear proclaimed about their heart or their body: “You have made a full recovery.” Who, after all, is fully recovered from life? Our bodies are resilient but always in the process of dying, even as they sometimes have the grace to regenerate.\n\nI listened for way too long to the wrong story about my face. I listened to a neurological expert who said that after six months my nerves would no longer grow, and that it didn’t matter if I did anything to help my face. He turned out to be wrong on both counts. Not only was I listening to the wrong narrative, I was writing the wrong narrative about my illness inside my own mind, a narrative full of shame and blame.\n\nAs a writer I should have been aware that the shape of a story can make things worse. It took me a decade to change my narrative about my face. Or to leave the story alone. To let the muscles be merely the muscles on my face, and to use my ability to make up stories in the service of making up other, different stories."
