      "We live in remarkable times and face many challenges to our well-being that can often feel insurmountable. It’s not uncommon these days to hear people describe a sense of despair and hopelessness when facing the social injustices and environmental destruction that surround us. Yet this challenging moment in the history of life on Earth, of humanity and of all nature, also provides an opportunity, a motivation for us to reimagine how we might live, individually and as a human and nature family on Earth, in ways that serve as collective inspiration for growth.\n\nIf the human mind is to blame for the difficulties we now face, then the human mind can be responsible for the awareness of these conditions and the actions that are possible to transform a destructive path into a constructive one. The mind shapes belonging, identity and self. If we clarify the mental lens through which we see the self and deepen our understanding of identity and belonging, we may be able to shift how we live and then create a path that cultivates more personal, public, and planetary health for us all. We are proposing that many of the challenges to global health we now experience in multiple ways affecting humanity — what can be called pandemics, a term that means involving all people, something affecting humanity — are caused by a limited and limiting view of “self”.\n\nOne form of pandemic we currently face is infectious disease — COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. But many pandemics affect us now. Another pandemic we face today is social injustice; the dehumanization and marginalization that emerges from in-group domination over out-groups that are subordinate in the social hierarchy. A third pandemic is environmental destruction; we now live in the Anthropocene era, impacting Earth and the environments that sustain us. A fourth pandemic is of misinformation and polarization, made rampant by the internet’s capacity to create self-sustaining bubbles of isolated information sharing. A fifth pandemic is of attention addiction, the draw of our attentional focus compelling states of endless comparison and competition and the ensuing feeling of inadequacy, inferiority, and incompleteness.\n\nAnd there is a sixth pandemic; the modern cultural, or what some might call Western, view of an isolated, separate identity — the “solo-self”. While this perspective may have originated in the West — in European-originated colonialist nations — it has now spread around the globe so extensively that a geographical indicator may no longer apply to this widespread cultural construction of self. This solo-self is not just the inner, private aspect of who we are but rather the concept and belief that the totality of our identity is separate from others, especially other, not “like-me” people, as well as separate from other nonhuman species. The consequences of this excessively differentiated identity and the disconnection from belonging that it creates are responsible for much suffering, both as the chaos and rigidity we may experience internally and as turmoil in our lives. By “relational”, I mean the way the bodily, inner self is connected to other people and to the planet, the whole of nature. These connections, involving patterns in the exchange of energy and information, may not be as visible to the eye as is the body, but they are equally real. When we live as a solo-self and ignore these important yet invisible connections, we experience our identity as centered predominantly in the body, and we feel relationally connected only to those who are like-me. This solo-self pandemic clearly has a negative impact on each of the other five pandemics — and may be a fundamental source of them. If how we have constructed what the self is, what our identity and belonging are based upon, is the source of many of the troubles we now face — then we can now change this pattern and move in a more integrative pathway forward.",
      "It is widely accepted that Plato defined art as imitation, though whether this was a theory or merely an observation is difficult to say, since there was nothing else by way of art in Athens in his time. All that seems clear is that imitation in Plato meant pretty much what it means in English: looks like the real thing but isn’t the real thing. But Plato was mainly negatively interested in art, since he was attempting to design an ideal society — a Republic! — and was eager to get rid of the artists on the grounds that art was of minimal practical use. To achieve this goal, he drew up a map of human knowledge, placing art at the lowest possible level — with reflections, shadows, dreams, and illusions. These Plato regarded as mere appearances, a category to which belonged the kinds of things an artist knew how to make. Thus artists could draw a table, meaning that they knew how tables appear. But could they actually make a table? Not likely but what good really was the appearance of a table?\n\nIn Book Ten of The Republic, Plato’s character — Socrates — suggested that if you want to imitate, nothing could be better for that than a mirror, which will give you perfect reflections of whatever you aim the mirror at, and better than an artist can usually achieve. So let’s get rid of the artists. But philosophers know the highest things, what Plato called ideas. Once the artists were out of the way, philosophers could teach and serve as rulers not susceptible to corruption.\n\nIn any case, no one can deny that art as practiced consisted in imitations or capturing appearances. How different from the present situation! “I am interested in how one approaches that topic — What is Art,” writes my friend the artist Tom Rose in a personal note. “The question that comes up in every class and in every context.” It is as if imitation disappeared, and something else took its place. So what is art? What we know from the cacophony of artistic argument is that there is too much art that is nonimitational for us to read Plato except for the sake of his views.\n\nMy thought is that if some art is imitation and some art is not, neither term belongs to the definition of art as philosophically understood. A property is part of the definition only if it belongs to every work of art there is. With the advent of Modernism, art backed away from mirror images, or, better, photography set the standard of fidelity.\n\nThere are degrees of fidelity in imitation, so Plato’s definition of art remained in place, with little to argue about until it stopped capturing the seeming essence of art. How could this have happened? Historically it happened with the advent of Modernism, with certain revolutionary changes that took place in France, mainly in Paris. In my view, to get a definition better than Plato’s you have to look to more recent artists, since they are most likely to subtract from their theories properties that were earlier thought to be essential to art, like beauty. Marcel Duchamp found a way of eradicating beauty in 1915, and Andy Warhol discovered that a work of art could exactly resemble a real thing in 1964, though the great movements of the 1960s — Fluxus, Pop Art, Minimalism, and Conceptual Art — made art that was not exactly imitation. Oddly, sculpture and photography shifted the center of artistic self-awareness in the seventies. After that, everything was feasible. Anything went, leaving it uncertain whether a definition of art is any longer possible. Anything cannot be art.\n\nIt was basically decided by leading aestheticians that art was indefinable, since there is no overarching feature. In contrast, art is an open concept. My view is that it has to be a closed concept. There must be some overarching properties that explain why art in some form is universal. What makes art so powerful a force as it appears to be in song and story is due to what makes it art to begin with. There is really nothing like it when it comes to stirring the spirit. If one believes that art is all of a piece, one needs to show that what makes it so is to be found throughout its history.",
      "definition of art given by Plato thus does not anymore, and people are questioning what art really is. In fact, in order to understand the meaning of art, we need to examine the art in the age of Modernism and when artists stopped copying what they saw. Furthermore, art in recent times has included such concepts as beauty and imitation, qualities that were believed in the past to be elements of art. Now anything seems feasible in art, and, according to many experts, no fixed definition is available. The author, however, argues that there must be an all-embracing definition of art, which can be found by examining the history of art. Art, for one thing, has the power to touch people’s hearts.\n\nRead the following dialogue between a man and a woman reuniting at an airport and answer the questions which follow.\n\nMr. Hiyoshi: Wow, you're a sight for sore eyes! How long has it been? Six months? Ms. Yagami: Six months, one week, and five days, to be exact. But who’s counting? Mr. Hiyoshi: I can't believe I’m finally here. So how do we get to your university? Do we need to catch a taxi? Ms. Yagami: No, Stanford’s here. He’s kindly offered to give us a ride.\n\nMr. Hiyoshi: Stanford? Ms. Yagami: You know Stanford. We're in the same lab together. I talk about him all the time. Maybe his name just slipped your mind.\n\nMr. Hiyoshi: He’s not someone I need to be worried about, is he? Ms. Yagami: That's not the green-eyed monster I hear in your voice, is it? Stanford’s not somebody you need to lose sleep over. He is definitely in the friend zone.\n\nMr. Hiyoshi: Sorry, maybe I didn’t get enough sleep on the plane. I’m reading too much into things. Now that you mention it, maybe I do remember Stanford. His name rings a bell.\n\nMs. Yagami: Sorry for keeping you waiting, Stan-chan. We're out in front of arrivals. Could you drive around and pick us up? Finally arrived in California. Didn’t get a wink of sleep on the plane. Was met at the airport by Ms. Yagami and Stanford. Don’t like the guy one bit. Ms. Yagami picked up on my suspicions. Assured me he was definitely in the friend zone. But she called him Stan-chan on the phone! I felt like the third wheel during the entire drive to the campus. All they wanted to talk about was people in their lab. Situation is serious. Must act soon. The ring is in my bag. It may be time to choose the question. At the airport I tried to sound the situation down. I said I might be reading too much into things. Make no mistake about it, that’s definitely not the case. Stanford is not happy in the friend zone. I can smell it steering away. Anyway, better get some sleep. Maybe it’s just the jet lag talking. I'll see things more clearly after a good night's rest.",
