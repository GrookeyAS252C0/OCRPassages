      "My Friend, Sherlock the Detective How should I begin to describe my good friend Sherlock? In terms of his physical appearance, he had a domed forehead, while his face was possessed of an aquiline quality, in large part owing to his hooked nose and piercing eyes. His thin yet athletic body pointed to a person whose talents were not confined to the merely cerebral, but who was also accustomed to undertaking physical as well as mental gymnastics. Typically, he would sit in his favorite armchair, puffing philosophically on his pipe and occasionally wafting from his face, with a casual wave of his hand, the smoke that rose from its bowl-shaped end. By the middle of each afternoon, a dense and fetid fog had filled his study and a heap of tobacco ash lay accumulating at his feet, upon which he wore slippers of the Turkish fashion. When in good humor, and with only a little cajoling, he would dust off his violin case, tighten his bow, and then entertain me with a breathtaking performance of Brahms. As for his character, by nature he inclined towards solitude, and would, moreover, commonly remain silent while those around him conversed passionately and at length. It would be wholly incorrect, however, to attribute his silence to diffidence. For, whenever the subject of sleuthing arose in conversations taking place around him, he would shake himself free from his private musings, and suddenly insert himself actively into the discussion, becoming rather excited. Indeed, in those instances, he would indulge himself considerably in descanting on his approach and methods regarding the solving of complex cases. This was frequently followed, much to his audience’s delight, by a display of his detailed knowledge of the proclivities of London’s criminals.",

Ren: It’s really cool! Have you used it yet? Miu: No, Ren: I think it’s amazing. It’s going to change the world! Miu: That’s for sure! But for the better or for the worse? Ren: Oh, for the better, Miu: Really? It doesn’t worry you at all then? Ren: No, not at all. Why? What concerns do you have about it? Miu: Well, for starters, for guys like us, there's the temptation to cheat when it comes to our written assignments.\n\nRen: You mean you're afraid that students like us will just get ChatGPT to write their assignments for them? Miu: Precisely! If I were behind and had an essay deadline rapidly approaching, being tempted to do just that, which would be cheating! Ren: That depends on how you look at it. We all already use the Internet to do research for our essays anyway, don't we? as an extension of that.\n\nMiu: Well I don’t! If you got a friend to write your essay for you, that would be cheating, wouldn’t it? Ren: Yes, of course.\n\nMiu: Then, between getting your friend to write your essay for you and getting ChatGPT to do so? Ren: . But if ChatGPT is available to everyone, then in it? It’s not like anyone has an unfair advantage over anyone else.\n\nMiu: Well, I don’t see it that way. , I have other misgivings. ChatGPT raises concerns over privacy and personal information, as well as about who owns the content that it creates, especially when it comes to art and music.\n\nRen: True, . I'm certain that politicians and government officials will soon come up with ways to deal with such matters. After all, they have done so quite effectively up to now.\n\nMiu: , and to prove my point, I'll give you an example. Governments have actually been very slow so far to address the harms that accompany social media. And the law always seems to be two steps behind when responding to what is taking place on the Internet.",
      "The sequence of remarks below are those made by a journalist, Karen Davila, talking to 2021 Nobel Peace Prize winner and journalist, Maria Ressa, who founded and heads Rappler, the Philippines’ leading digital media organization. Ressa’s responses that follow have been rearranged and numbered. Choose the number of the response that most appropriately follows each remark to produce the most natural conversation overall. All numbers must be used.\n\nSo, how did you get to become an internationally esteemed investigative journalist and win a Nobel Prize? Your very powerful Nobel Prize acceptance speech addressed the harm that technology has done. Tell us more about writing that.\n\nYou're obviously brave. The Philippine authorities issued you with ten arrest warrants in the space of two years and you have had several criminal complaints brought against you because of your work. Do you personally get scared? How did your upbringing influence you? If you weren’t a journalist, what would you be? Is there anything you regret as a journalist? What else do you want to do? So, are you still optimistic? We have to be, otherwise, there’s nothing left. That’s part of the reason we took the position we did in Rappler, because I also know that we’re on the right side of history. So, what will you sacrifice for the truth? This is it; now’s the time for the good guys to come together and step forward. If you’re listening, this is the moment! No, no! Because although we journalists make mistakes, we make up for not being perfect by being transparent. When we make a mistake, we tell people what it is. That’s the way I look at power: the person holding the power needs to turn the guardrails on themselves, because the people with the greatest power are the ones who must have the strictest consciences; they cannot use that power for self-gain.\n\nI don’t know! The reason I didn’t choose a career in theatre or music was because it was so focused on one thing; like when I was practicing the piano or the violin for music competitions, I would practice six hours a day. When you put that much of yourself in, then you take away other parts of yourself. It also means you're building yourself for other people’s approval. I really didn’t want to live a life like that... What I am doing now is about impact in our world. It’s about making the world better. It is about leaving it better than when you came into it.\n\nUltimately, see a vigorous democracy, working institutions, checks and balances, corruption brought down to sustainable levels. Doing the right thing needs to be enough of an incentive to keep our people in the Philippines building a better world. There’s so much that needs to be done, Karen! I’m so worried about the next generation, growing up on social media, who are shaped by social media and what social media reinforce. It is the worst of human nature. It rewards anger, hate and nastiness.\n\nI don’t think it’s a triumphant moment: people think this is a chance to celebrate, but it’s also a signal that things could get a lot worse. The last time a journalist was given this prize was almost 80 years ago, in 1936, in Germany under Hitler. That was Carl von Ossietzky, who was sent to a Nazi prison camp because of his reporting. So that was what I began my lecture with. Actually, I had the hardest time composing it, because I knew what was at stake for the Philippines, for journalists and, frankly, for the world. I’ve been talking for five years about the role social media platforms have played in destroying democracy.\n\nMy father died when I was a year old and then my mother migrated to the United States. It was a shock to go from the Philippines to this classroom in a public school in the middle of winter in the States. So, I think my biggest lesson was that there isn’t just one view of the world. And maybe that’s part of the reason I question everything. Then my stepfather, who raised us, is Italian American. So, our family life itself was a blend of these different cultures. This is a great lesson for a journalist: that there’s more than one way to interpret everything; that you want to understand the root causes, instead of jumping to conclusions.\n\nI think about living a life that has meaning. We each try to build our life looking for meaning. In the age of social media, meaning is so much harder to find. But meaning isn’t something someone gives you; it’s every single little choice you make that builds meaning in your life. I don’t think you can set out to get an award; instead, I think what you try to do is you build a life of meaning and then these things happen. Journalism gave me a sense of mission, a sense of purpose; it gave my life meaning. You live the best life you think you can, and you do that by setting goals outside of yourself. You look at impact — you don’t look at gain.\n\nAlways. The rule of law is fragile, and when we have these repeated attacks... when we allow a",
      "political reason for filing a legal case, you weaken the entire system of the rule of law. But we will fight in court. And I appeal to the justices, to the judges, to go back to the rule of law... Did I ever think that the law would be weaponized? No. But what do you do? Do you accept it? No. I know my rights were violated. And because they were, I can speak out with certainty. (Adapted from an interview between Karen Davila and Maria Ressa.)",
      "A new study conducted by three Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) scholars has found that false news spreads more rapidly on the social network Twitter than real news does — and by a substantial margin. “We found that falsehood spreads significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth, in all categories of information, and in many cases by a great degree,” says Professor Sinan Aral, co-author of a new paper detailing the findings. Associate Professor Deb Roy, who previously served as Twitter's chief media scientist from 2013 to 2017 and who is also a co-author of the study, adds that the researchers were “somewhere between surprised and stunned” at the difference in how true and false news circulates on Twitter. Moreover, interestingly, the scholars also found that the spread of false information is essentially not due to bots (computer programs that perform automatic tasks) that are programmed to spread inaccurate stories. Instead, false news speeds faster around Twitter due to people retweeting inaccurate news items.\n\nThe study provides the following findings. False news stories are 70 percent more likely to be retweeted than true stories are. It also takes true stories about six times as long to reach 1,500 people as it does for false stories to reach the same number of people. When it comes to Twitter's “cascades,” or unbroken chains of retweets, falsehoods reach a cascade depth of 10 about 20 times faster than facts. Moreover, falsehoods are retweeted by unique users more broadly than true statements at every depth of cascade.\n\nThe origins of the study involve the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings and their fatal consequences, which received massive attention on Twitter.\n\nOf the 126,000 cascades, politics comprised the biggest news category, with about 45,000, followed by urban legends (that is, fictional anecdotes that people spread as if they were true stories), business, terrorism, science, entertainment, and natural disasters. The circulation of false stories was more apparent for political news than for news in the other categories. These findings provoke a basic question: Why does false information spread more quickly than the truth on Twitter? Aral, Roy, and Vosoughi suggest the answer may reside in human psychology: People like new things. “False news is more novel, and people are more likely to share novel information,” says Aral. And on social media, people can gain attention or status by being the first to share unknown, but possibly false, information. Thus, as Aral puts it, “people who circulate new information are seen as being in the know.” All three researchers think the scale of the effect they found is highly significant and agree that it is important to think about ways to limit the spread of misinformation; they hope their results will encourage more research on the subject. Aral notes how the recognition that humans, not bots, spread false news more quickly suggests a general approach to the problem. “Now actions to change human behavior become even more important in our fight to stop the spread of false news,” he says, “whereas if it were just bots, we would need a technological solution.” Vosoughi, for his part, suggests that if some people are deliberately spreading false news while others are doing so without intending to, then the phenomenon is a two-part problem that may require multiple tactics in response.\n\nThe three MIT scholars say it is possible that similar dynamics occur on other social media platforms, including Facebook, but they emphasize that careful studies are needed on that and other related issues. Roy believes that the current findings may help create “measurements or indicators that could become established standards” for social networks, advertisers, and other parties, urging that “science needs to have more support, both from industry and government, in order to do more studies.” For now, Roy says, even Twitter users with good intentions might reflect on a simple idea: “Think before you retweet.”",
      "On Twitter, true statements are less widely retweeted by individuals at each level of cascade. On Twitter, true stories tend to be six times longer than false stories. However, in the aftermath of the tragic events, he adds, “I realized that a good portion of what I was reading on social media was rumors; it was false news.” To determine whether stories were true or false, the team used the assessments of six fact-checking organizations, and found that their judgments were in agreement more than 95 percent of the time. Subsequently, he teamed up with Aral and Roy, with the three of them setting out to objectively identify news stories as true or false, and then chart their circulation on Twitter. To conduct the study, the researchers tracked roughly 126,000 cascades of news stories spreading on Twitter, which were tweeted in total over 4.5 million times by about 3 million people, from the years 2006 to 2017. “Twitter became people’s main source of news,” Soroush Vosoughi, the other co-author of the new paper, says.\n\nDespite having had previous experience of working in the industry, I still hadn’t expected such results. It would be interesting to find out if what was observed here can similarly be witnessed elsewhere on social media, and if so, to establish whether it is taking place to a lesser or greater extent than on Twitter. I guess you could say that out of that terrible public tragedy came a personal realization, one which led to my working with the others and beginning research that would explain and make known the extent to which false information was circulating on social media. One first needs to accept the fact that people wish to acquire higher social standing and recognition through appearing to possess information not widely known, and then focus on modifying how people act."
