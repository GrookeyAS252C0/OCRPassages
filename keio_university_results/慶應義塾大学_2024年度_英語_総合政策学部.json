      "Today, freelancers represent 35% of the United States workforce. In the European Union, the rate is 16.1%. Both figures demonstrate the same global trend: from creative entrepreneurs to those paid by the task, freelancing is on the rise worldwide. So, too, are analyses of this phenomenon, as journalists, sociologists, human resources specialists, life coaches, even freelancers themselves try to “uncover the truth” about freelancing. That’s because the “gig economy”, as it is sometimes called, is a Janus-faced — and relentlessly evolving — phenomenon. Freelancing is often portrayed as liberating, empowering, and even glamorous, but the reality is far more complex.\n\nIn OECD countries, studies show that these individuals work chiefly in the service sector (60% of men and 70% of women). The remainder are everything from online assistants to architects, designers, and photographers. A 2017 study found that the majority of freelancers in OECD countries are “slashers”, meaning that their contract work supplements another part-time or full-time position. These additional earnings can vary considerably. Those who spend a few hours a month editing instruction manuals from home may earn a few hundred euros a month. Freelance occupational therapists may hold onto ten times more than they would working full-time in this growing industry.\n\nPerhaps the most glamorous face of freelancing is the so-called creative class, an agile, connected, highly educated and globalised category of workers that specialise in communications, media, design, art, and tech, among other sectors. They are architects, web designers, bloggers, consultants, and the like, whose job it is to stay on top of trends. The most cutting-edge among them end up playing the role of social “influencers”.\n\nIn London, this group has been partially responsible for what the economist Douglas McWilliams has dubbed the “fiat-white economy”, a flourishing, coffee-fuelled market based on creativity, which combines innovative approaches to business and lifestyle. Such hipsters, who are also referred to as “proficians”, may be relatively successful in their self-employment, with numerous gigs and a wide portfolio of clients. For McWilliams, they just might represent the future of British prosperity. Also working hard, though in a much less exalted fashion, are the “precarians”. These task-tacklers work long hours carrying out repetitive tasks, often for a single online platform like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Most of their gigs do not require a high level of expertise and creativity, and are thus easily interchangeable.\n\nJob security is not assured for these online helpers, and though they likely work for a single company, as employees do, benefits are almost certainly nonexistent. Between the creative class and those struggling to juggle enough gigs to get by, there are plenty of in-betweeners: bloggers driven by their passion to write but struggling to earn a decent living; online assistants satisfied with their jobs who had previously faced unemployment; students earning a few extra euros by working a handful of hours a week as graphic designers.\n\nFreelancers constitute a diverse population of workers — their educational backgrounds, motivations, ambitions, needs, and willingness to work differ from one worker to the next, and it is accordingly difficult for commentators to accurately represent their diversity without resorting to caricature. Freelancing is increasingly a choice that people make in order to escape the 9-to-5 workday. Many freelancers, whatever their job, may have originally opted for this employment model because it offers (or seemed to offer) freedom — the freedom to work anytime and, in some cases, anywhere. Only 37% of current US freelancers say they resort to gig work out of necessity; in 2014, that figure was higher, at 47%.\n\nOf course, this is not the end of salaried workers. Full-time, company-based work is still the standard for employment in most Western countries, as it is in Russia. Nevertheless, with the rise of telecommuting and automation and the unlimited potential of crowdsourcing, it stands to reason that more and more firms will begin running, and even growing, their businesses with considerably fewer employees. This does not necessarily mean an increase in unemployment. Instead, it likely means more freelancers, who will form and reform around various projects in constant and evolving networks.\n\nThe rise of freelancing may be a key visible indicator of the future of work, notably in terms of collaboration practices. Freelancers are already facilitating the co-management of projects. Soon enough, they will also be producing, communicating, and collaborating with firms, customers, and with society at large. Given that they are not a homogeneous class of workers, managing these new managers will not be simple. Currently, there is not a single social protection system that cleanly corresponds to all freelancers, from house cleaners and taxi drivers to architects and news editors. How can these individuals group and work together to promote and defend their diverse employment interests? Surely, some ambitious freelancer is on the case right now.",

Innovative approaches.\n\nWhat three advantages of working as a freelancer are mentioned by the author? Opportunity to be creative, work flexible hours, engage in remote work.\n\nWhich of the following is not true according to the passage? Recently, fewer Americans freelance as a last resort.\n\nWhich of the following statements would the author most likely endorse? More needs to be done to nurture and protect the working rights of freelancers.",
      "For as long as anyone can remember, each generation has seen its successors as being ruder, lewder and cruder than they were themselves. Laments over the decline of civility are more common than those over the decline of civilisation, with the latter sometimes attributed to the former. But even if the old codgers are right, there is a philosophical question worth acting out in the way society understands manners, and it concerns their moral status.\n\nWhy fret about politeness, some may ask, when we have more serious things to worry about, from social injustices to existential threats? Would it truly matter if we lost our manners? This is a natural question to ask, and it is given some force by the influence of religion on many of our worldviews. In this tradition, ethics is about what we owe to our maker. God’s law is otherworldly, both in its origins and in its consequences. The divine will commands and our eternal salvation depends on whether we obey. Compared to this, etiquette seems to be trivial, purely conventional and lacking any moral force. But step away from the religious outlook and one sees how ethics and etiquette are intimately linked. Both concern norms of how we should treat one another.\n\nIn any secular framing, ethics has a much more pragmatic function than divine purpose. For the ancients, it was about how we best live together, for our own flourishing and for that of society. Pretty much everyone agrees on the most necessary rules to follow to make this possible: don’t kill, injure, steal or lie — at least not routinely. But good people do more than avoid these egregious wrongdoings. They say thank you, open doors for others, don’t interrupt and so on.\n\nThese little acts help to lubricate our social interactions, making everyone’s lives more pleasant. They send small signals about our concern for others, our good intent, our willingness to cooperate and our lack of petty selfishness. One distinguishing feature of etiquette is that much of it is arbitrary in ways that ethics is largely not. Shaking hands is no more inherently polite than bowing or bumping fists. In contrast, there is nothing culturally relative about the wrongness of causing physical harm.\n\nBut while this might make it look as though etiquette is fundamentally different from ethics, it is actually just ethics in its most serious guise. Indeed, when it comes to big moral issues, social mores make a difference. Taking what is not rightfully yours is universally thought to be wrong, but what is considered to be private property varies enormously. Prohibitions against violence are universal but the content of them is not, and what some societies consider illegitimate lynching is in others permitted — or even obligated — retribution. Likewise, all cultures value showing due respect and differ only in what they think most merits it.\n\nEtiquette, like all aspects of ethics, varies across time and place. But its purpose remains constant: to provide a set of shared, widely understood and accepted rules that keep society functioning harmoniously, as long as most of us follow them most of the time. That’s why it is not foolish to be indignant about incivility. Ignoring etiquette is a small offence at best and a serious wrongdoing at worst. To refuse politeness is to refuse to take your place in society, to throw grit into the wheels of social interaction. Like littering and petty shoplifting, what is harmless when done rarely by a few would be harmful if done regularly by the many.\n\nOn the other hand, rudeness can serve important positive functions precisely because it is a disruption of our social life. It can be necessary to make it clear to someone that you will not show them the respect they believe they are entitled to. It may be impolite not to kneel before the monarch, for example, but if I were ever to meet King Charles, I would be willing to offend in order to stand up for my republican principles. Boris Johnson, a former British prime minister, could expect less respect and it is hard to see how I could convey my disgust for his behaviour in politics while neglecting the norms of politeness. Civility is a basic duty of citizenship. But when the status quo no longer deserves respect, good manners cease to be cooperation and become instead complicity.",

      "Welcome to 2020 — everyone has a voice and consumers aren’t afraid to use theirs. And two of those loudest voices are shouting about hot button issues: purchasing fashionable items on a tight budget and the ethical do-good, feel-good awareness factor of the clothes that are made. The concern over working conditions and ethical sources behind fashion is nothing new. As long as the term “sweatshop” has been around, there have been advocates against them. But human nature is also built on a duality — and sometimes a lie. For all the preaching on caring about the human worker, does the average consumer even really care? Fashion Nova, a company that has perfected fast fashion for the Instagram crowd, illustrates this fact. The mostly online retailer leans on a vast network of celebrities, influencers, and random selfie takers who post about the brand on social media. It is built to satisfy a very online clientele, mass-producing cheap clothes that look expensive. “They need to buy a lot of different styles and probably only wear them a couple times so their Instagram feeds can stay fresh,” Richard Saghian, Fashion Nova’s founder, said in an interview last year. To enable that habit, he gives them a constant stream of new options that are priced to sell. Fashion Nova's skintight denim goes for $24.99. And, Saghian said, the company can get its clothes made “in less than two weeks,” often by manufacturers in Los Angeles, a short drive from the company’s headquarters. That model hints at an ugly secret behind the brand’s runaway success: The federal Labor Department has found that many Fashion Nova garments are stitched together by a workforce in the United States that is paid illegally low wages. However, when The New York Times broke the story that Fashion Nova was exploiting Los Angeles-based sweatshops, no one really blinked an eye. It was a breaking story that wasn't really breaking news.\n\nFor clothes so cheap, sweatshops are kind of expected. The revelation that these are American sweatshops, though, probably should’ve ruffled a few more feathers. That’s partly because there’s a false sense of righteousness that owes its existence to word associations. “Made in the USA,” especially, is often a false flag operation of a buzzword. When someone sees an item is made in America, there are certain assumptions made: - That it’s made with fair labor practices. - That it’s directly supporting American businesses that are ethical. - That, even if it is cheap, it’s somehow thanks to a loophole and not shady production.\n\nIn all situations, some of these — or all — are sometimes true. But the old adages of “too good to be true” and “having your cake and eating it too” — the clothing being the cake, the peace of mind that comes from ethical business practices being the icing — ring very true here. There's a certain general consensus that when bad things happen, they’re usually worlds away — either distance or class — and never right in our own backyard.\n\nBut fast fashion’s dark side is happening in our own backyard, and you have to wonder whether or not anyone even cares. Los Angeles is a biting dichotomy: activists and influencers shout about human rights, meanwhile sweatshops are a dirty little secret. It’s not in China, but in America that workers put in grueling 12-hour days, making garments that will be sold for anywhere from $5 to $75 for around three cents apiece paid out. The goal of making what amounts to five dollars an hour is in reality a pipe dream for them. Just ask Mercedes Cortes, who sewed Fashion Nova clothes for several months at Coco Love, a dusty factory close to Fashion Nova’s offices in Vernon, California. “There were cockroaches. There were rats,” she said. “The conditions weren't good.” She worked every day of the week, but her pay varied depending on how quickly her fingers could move. Ms. Cortes was paid for each piece of a shirt she sewed together — about four cents to sew on each sleeve, five cents for each of the side seams, eight cents for the seam on the neckline. On average, she earned $270 in a week, the equivalent of $4.66 an hour, she said.\n\nThe majority of this workforce is, unsurprisingly, comprised of undocumented immigrants who are left with few other choices for work. According to the California Bureau of Labor Statistics, of the over 46,000 individuals who make up Los Angeles’s second-largest industry (the so-called “cut-and-sew” labor force), 71% are immigrants. “It has all the advantages of a sweatshop system,” said David Weil, who led the United States Labor Department’s wage and hour division from 2014 to 2017. “Consumers can say, ‘Well, of course that’s what it’s like in Bangladesh or Vietnam,’ but they are developing countries,” Mr. Weil said. “People just don’t want to believe it's true in their own",
      "adversary protagonist of the fast fashion industry — care that their trendy new boots were paid for with pennies, putting a literal dollar value on a worker's life? Or does that $25 price point make it worth it? Gildan Activewear, known better to the public for purchasing American Apparel, was one of the first fast fashion brands to come under the microscope after that purchase. While American Apparel had long been known for their “Made in the USA” claims, that previously long-held perception was no more, as they now used factories primarily in the Caribbean and Central America, and the public noticed.\n\nThe recent article on Fashion Nova in The New York Times takes that scandal a step further by acknowledging that the fast fashion brand may be indeed using American-based labor, but that labor is unethical as heck. The American factories they use owe over $3.8 million in wages to workers. Ms. Cortes was one such worker. In 2016, she left Coco Love and later abandoned a settlement with the company for $5,000 in back wages. She continued to work in factories sewing Fashion Nova clothes, noticing the $12 price tags on the tops",
      "a simple task that is very easy to complete given one's abilities What does the example of Mercedes Cortes illustrate in paragraph 5? People who make clothes can earn between $5 and $75 an hour, depending on how quickly they work. Dirt and rodents in factories are preventing “cut-and-sew” workers from realizing higher wages. Greater efficiency could be achieved if workers specialized in sewing specific parts of the clothing. It is difficult for people who sew clothes to make more than $5.00 an hour even if they work hard.\n\nWhat is the Los Angeles “dichotomy” that the author describes in paragraph 5? Consumers are taking steps to prevent unfair practices at home while buying fast fashion made in overseas sweatshops. Many people say they care about the rights of workers but seem ignorant of all the labor abuses that are happening nearby. Famous influencers protest fast fashion companies although they accept free goods and advertising deals from those companies. Clothes produced using sweatshops are cheap, but consumers are unaware of the tax fraud committed by the factory owners.\n\nWhich of the following information is not present in paragraph 6? The government reports that most of America’s workers are foreigners who entered unofficially. Clothes buyers prefer to think that unfair working conditions are only a problem in other countries. A new pair of boots that is made in Los Angeles may cost less than a dollar to produce. The manufacture of clothing is one of the largest sectors of the Los Angeles economy.\n\nAccording to the author, what can be said about American Apparel? Its manufacturing base is now mainly located in the United States of America. The company was the instigator of a hostile takeover of Gildan Activewear. The company has moved its production facilities to multiple foreign countries. Its customers do not seem to be aware of their “Made in the USA” branding.\n\nOf the following, which is closest to the kind of US labor described as “unethical as heck” in paragraph 8? businesses that fail to remunerate employees for the work they provide factories that do not provide fringe benefits to their employees employees who cannot unionize to negotiate for better conditions employees who steal from their employers while performing their duties.\n\nThe comment from Erica Mcirhans in paragraph 8 indicates that Fashion Nova admits to some mistakes but denies allegations of underpaying workers. is working with the government to improve conditions in their factories. has considered taking legal action against people accusing them of wrongdoing. rejects the idea that the company is in any way guilty of mistreating labor.\n\nThe author claims that American influencers are used to help mask the fact that fast fashion, even when made in America, is often produced by exploiting workers. most fast fashion clothes are made from organic materials but will only last one season. fast fashion clothes are luxury goods that are too exorbitant for lay consumers. the fast fashions they are helping to market were actually manufactured abroad."
