      "On June 4, 1927, a crowd of 4,000 gathered for a ceremony to open the new Harvard Business School campus. This was the period known as the “roaring twenties,” a prosperous time for the United States. The New York Stock Exchange had experienced astonishing gains over the past five years, and the concentration of wealth was approaching a level not seen again until the 2000s. The short address Dean Wallace B. Donham gave was, however, more of a warning than a celebration. Scientific advances had opened up “new opportunities for happiness,” he observed, but these could not be secured without “a higher degree of responsibility.” Business leaders needed to develop “social consciousness,” accompanied by “keen intelligence and wide vision.” He further remarked: “Unless more of our business leaders learn to exercise their powers with an acute sense of responsibility towards other groups in the community, our civilization may well head for one of its periods of decline.” Donham did not ask businesspeople to donate more money to charity for the less fortunate. Rather, he called upon them to this gap in responsible leadership he identified and thereby save “civilization.” The Dean’s warning of a great threat to humanity did not excite much attention amid the booming 1920s, but his words were prophetic. Towards the end of 1929, the New York stock market crash would set off a massive economic depression in the US and beyond, with profound economic and political consequences for the decade that followed.\n\nDonham was neither the first nor the last person to ask business leaders to make a positive social impact beyond generating profits. Businesses of one sort or another have been around for millennia, and so have questions about corporate ethics and responsibility — the greed of merchants and financiers has been a constant across all societies. For instance, as modern industry emerged in eighteenth-century Britain, there were breathtaking examples of dishonesty and moral failure, as well as extravagant financial deceptions. Trickery and betrayals were regular occurrences. But so was the push for greater social awareness.\n\nScottish social philosopher Adam Smith is widely thought to have cast aside worries about the destructive aspects of money-hungry practices. In The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, he suggested that when they pursue their own interests, people in business often contribute to the social good more effectively than when they try to do so intentionally. While Smith therefore supported free enterprise for most individuals, he did not do this for those greedy investors who sought “extraordinary profits.” To rein in their activities, he supported legal restrictions on interest rates and also made clear his contempt for gross inequality. “No society can surely be flourishing and happy,” he remarked, “of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.” Fast-forward to the twenty-first century: calls for greater corporate social responsibility frequently arise in the context of looming ecological crises, social inequalities, and troubled democracies in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, declared in his annual letter to CEOs in 2018: “Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.” Likewise, Dominic Barton, chairman of private investment firm LeapFrog Investments, has denounced short-term thinking by companies that are obsessed with quarterly reporting and blinded to the existence of other important objectives. In 2019, 181 chief executives from the Business Roundtable, an association of leaders of the largest US corporations, signed a statement pledging to run their companies “for the benefit of all stakeholders — customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and shareholders.” There is reason to be skeptical whether these calls for enhanced responsibility will be answered more than Donham’s were. Global business today is relentlessly profit-seeking and warps institutions of government and law to serve. The opening decades of the twenty-first century saw an extraordinary series of corporate scandals in the United States and many other countries, and there is plenty of evidence of repeated ethical lapses. But as part of an alternative movement, many younger entrepreneurs are committed to addressing environmental issues and social injustice, and place purpose and social responsibility at the heart of their business models.\n\nThe history of private business yields concrete examples of deeply responsible business leaders operating at different times and in different contexts. None is the formula for how to re-imagine a complex system such as capitalism. Rather, they are useful because they show how individual efforts to pursue an increased sense of responsibility have succeeded and failed, and why. Deeply responsible business leaders are regular human beings with all the shortcomings of people in general. Some are inspirational, but some of their experiments in social purpose were not successful or sustainable. In some cases, virtuous intentions did not bear fruit at all. The record of such businesses challenges naive assumptions that doing good will necessarily be good business. Pursuing profits and purpose is never easy, and sometimes the two goals are in conflict. But at this time of economic, environmental, and social challenge, deep responsibility is not an idealistic fantasy, but rather an essential path for the future.",
      "The answer is: 1).\n\nThe answer is: 2).\n\nThe answer is: 3).\n\nIn the context of this passage, choose the best answer for each question.\n\nAt the opening ceremony in 1927, Donham warned of the effects of business leaders rejecting scientific insight. Donham’s words were prophetic in that American society did come to confront serious crises in the 1930s. Adam Smith supported legal restrictions on interest rates because he did not want investors to gain huge profits while most others are impoverished.\n\nWhich one of the following do companies engaged in short-term thinking generally do? The answer is: 7). They single-mindedly pursue profits and overlook their social missions.\n\nThe author writes that there is reason to be skeptical about the effectiveness of calls for responsibility in the twenty-first century because global business is greedy, with companies knowingly violating ethical codes.\n\nWhich one of the following statements best describes the author’s approach to history? The answer is: 9). Knowledge of historical context enables us to identify the causes of contemporary problems.\n\nWhich one of the following statements is consistent with the author's view about responsibility in business? The answer is: 1). The debate about ethical business practices started with the rise of capitalism.",
      "A lot of confusion about the concept of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) results from people talking about it as though it were a single, precisely defined social benefit policy. It’s more helpful to think of the UBI as a family of proposals. All versions have three key elements. Beyond these elements, however, the differences between proposals can be enormous, so much so that asking whether someone supports “a UBI” is almost meaningless. The real question is: what kind of UBI — if any — do you support?\n\nThe first thing all UBI proposals have in common is that they involve unrestricted cash payments. Most other government programs provide free or discounted access to various types of goods and services rather than money itself. Those government programs that do provide cash often restrict where it can be spent. A UBI, in contrast, gives people cash that they can use in any way they see fit. Second, the cash payments that a UBI provides are unconditional. This means that eligibility — whether people qualify to receive the payment or not — is not dependent on whether they’re working or not, whether they’re trying to find work, or why they can’t work. This is one of the most distinctive features of a UBI compared with other social welfare policies. Finally, a UBI is often said to be “universal” in the sense that everybody gets it, rich and poor alike. In fact, this is often taken to be the central defining feature of a UBI. After all, the “U” in “UBI” stands for “Universal.”\n\nThe third element, universality, turns out to be somewhat tricky. No UBI proposal that we have seen actually recommends making payments to everyone. For instance, non-citizens or children are often excluded. And while most supporters of a UBI say that eligibility for the grant is not dependent on income or wealth, nobody really means this. Here’s why. A UBI that gave money to everybody would either be so expensive as to be unmanageable, or pay such small amounts as to be practically useless to the people who need it most.\n\nIn order to provide a reasonably sized grant to those who are most in need of it, you have to limit benefits to only include individuals or households under a certain income threshold or cut-off line. Some proposals do this on the front-end, only giving money to people whose income falls below a certain threshold. But if you don't limit benefits on the front end, you need to do it on the back end. In other words, you give everybody money, but then you tax some or all of the benefit back from people whose income exceeds a certain level. Such a program is still universal in a sense. But also, sort of, not really.\n\nBeyond these three very broad features, there is a lot of variation among UBI proposals. And as they say, “the Devil is in the details.” Whether a UBI would be a good idea or not probably depends a lot more on how these details are fleshed out than on the broad characteristics that all UBIs share.\n\nOne important question is how large the UBI will be. For example, a UBI of 500 US dollars per month is a pretty common proposal. But there have been proposals for much larger UBIs as well as for much smaller ones. How large a UBI ought to be will depend, in part, on what you think a UBI is for. Is the purpose of a UBI to supplement the income of people working in low-wage jobs? Is it to provide a steady stream of income for the temporarily unemployed? Or is it to provide a permanent income, a way for people to meet their basic needs without ever having to work again in their life? A relatively modest UBI might be sufficient to accomplish the first two goals. But the third would require a significantly more generous grant.\n\nA closely related issue involves how we would go about paying for a UBI. Giving $500 per month to every one of the 330 million or so people currently living in the United States would cost $165 billion per year — a significant amount of money. Should we pay for it by taxing personal income? Taxing corporations? Cutting other programs? Obviously, the larger the UBI, the more pressing and difficult this question becomes.\n\nLet’s return to the question of eligibility. Most proposals view the UBI as an individual entitlement. That is, they imagine the UBI being paid to individuals, and not to families or households. But should it be given to children or only to adults? Should it be given to anybody living in the country, or only citizens or permanent residents? Should murderers receive it? Should there be income restrictions? We'll have to explore these questions. For now, though, we can understand the UBI as a family of loosely related policies that involve direct, unconditional, and sort-of universal cash payments.",
      "why a UBI can distribute money to so many people why a UBI must be offered to citizens and non-citizens alike why a UBI should not be paid to the rich and the poor alike What do the authors mean by the phrase \"do it on the back end\"? The answer is: make payments only to low-income people impose a tax on people with higher incomes enable wealthy people to receive tax returns restrict benefits to those who pay income tax What does the word \"one\" stand for? The answer is: dollar million month person Which one of the following best describes the central issue the authors address in this passage? The answer is: People tend to think that UBI proposals are all the same when in reality they differ in many ways People like to say that a UBI should be offered with certain restrictions but that would be unfair People often think that a UBI is an individual entitlement when in fact it is offered to families People believe that a UBI gives money to all citizens, though wealthy people are actually not eligible\n\nIn all UBIs, people receive money sufficient to cover living expenses goods and services that suit their needs cash rather than tickets or discount coupons the same amount of money regardless of age Which one of the following titles best represents the content of the passage? The answer is: The UBI Project: Philosophical Assumptions The UBI Project in the Context of American Political History Why National UBI Proposals Will Solve Economic Inequality Understanding UBI Proposals: Common Features and Differences",
      "Most advances are incremental, with each generation of developments gradually building on those of its predecessors. Despite their slower pace, however, over time they can have profound consequences. The falling cost of air travel and transport, for instance, has not just opened up long-distance travel to a wider range of people globally, but it has also made possible complex supply chains, where parts for goods are flown around the world from different locations before final assembly.\n\nRevolutionary advance, meanwhile, comes either from sudden scientific breakthroughs, or from the combination and refinement of several existing technologies to create a product or service that quickly sweeps across the world. The development of antibiotics is a good example of the first; the smartphone of the second. One transformed medical treatments, with a massive impact on human health; the other transformed the way people engage in global communication, with a massive impact on human behavior.\n\nRevolutionary advance creates a problem for anyone trying to predict the direction and application of technology. We can make judgments about how incremental advance will affect us, and, while these may turn out to be right or wrong, at least they will be based on what we can already observe as possible or seems likely to happen. We are dealing, so to speak, with “known unknowns.” Revolutionary advance is a case of “unknown unknowns” — things that are extraordinarily hard to predict.\n\nThe classic example of that has been the impact of the iPhone. Steve Jobs, presenting the iPhone in 2007, famously said: “Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.” He was right, of course. It did. But even he could not have imagined the scale of the revolution. How could he? He presented it as an iPod on which you could make telephone calls and connect to the internet, not as an entry point to location-based services such as Uber, because Uber did not exist. Could Uber have existed until a collection of technologies including online maps became available? And Jobs certainly did not imagine the cultural impact of “selfies” — early iPhones were not made so that users could easily take photos of themselves.\n\nPredicting revolutionary changes is difficult even for a visionary like Jobs, but fortunately, we have two anchors. One is that the laws of physics don’t change. We can still improve products and services within the scope of those laws. We do things cheaper, better, and faster, and these improvements raise our living standards. However, there are limits, and, as we approach these, innovation slows down. It takes roughly the same time now to fly across the Atlantic from London to New York as it did in 1960. New and unpredictable advances will occur in areas where we have not yet explored the limits of physics. Biotechnology and artificial intelligence are two obvious areas to look for them. But we cannot predict what we will find there.\n\nThe other anchor is that while the aspirations and desires of human beings may gradually over time, our core hopes and fears remain pretty stable. The big things we want from technology do not change much. They include peace, community, families, health, and entertainment. Technologies that help us towards those goals will stay with us. One such example is social media. Families and friends are important; a WhatsApp group helps keep families and friends together by allowing them to dip in and out of conversation with each other. The usefulness of any technology is not just about its impact on economic efficiency. It is about something much deeper: whether it helps us fulfill our basic human needs.\n\nCombine physics and human desires and we have a framework for thinking about how technology will advance over the next generation. There are two tests. First, can something be done, and done at a price society can afford? And, second, do people need and want it to be done? The answer must be yes to both for technological advances to change the way we live.\n\nThere is a further twist. What we want technology to do changes over the years. For much of our history, we have needed it first and foremost to take care of our essential needs. So we gradually developed better methods of farming, crops that produced higher yields, and clever ways of storing and conserving food products. We also found ways to heat our homes efficiently and safely. More recently, since the Industrial Revolution, we have used technology to make huge improvements in living standards, an increasing proportion of the world’s population out of basic self-sufficiency towards more secure and comfortable lifestyles.\n\nThose earlier objectives hold true today, for there are still too many hungry people in the world. But, looking forward, the focus is changing again. We now need technological advance to do something more. It has to reduce the damage humankind has inflicted on the planet. That will be one of the great themes for the next few decades.",

      "Government plans to introduce bilingual road signs in English and the te reo Maori language in New Zealand — or Aotearoa known to the Maori — have sparked a divisive debate. By including te reo Maori on road signs, New Zealand’s government hopes to foster a sense of unity with the native Maori community as part of its efforts to address hardships Maori people suffered in the wake of British colonialism. But some political groups have attacked the government’s plans.\n\nThe Maori community makes up almost a quarter of New Zealand’s population of 5.15 million. Slightly less than a quarter of Maori people speak te reo Maori as one of their first languages. Opponents use this as an argument against the bilingual signs, stating that 95% of New Zealanders speak English according to the most recent census. Supporters use the same data as an argument in favor. For their part, the Maori community and the New Zealand government see bilingual signs as one way of preserving te reo Maori and encouraging its use.\n\nAn extra language will result in less space for the English words, opponents say, and smaller letters will be harder for motorists to read. While the government acknowledges that some people are worried about “safety issues” related to the plans, it points to the example of Wales in the United Kingdom, where signs featuring both Welsh and English have improved safety by including speakers of the two most common local languages.\n\nKasem Coocharukul, an engineering scholar who specializes in traffic behavior, says there is no evidence that bilingual road signs in themselves negatively impact a driver’s comprehension. Rather, it is the design and placement of road signs that matters when it comes to traffic safety, he says.",
      "“Hypothesis-based thinking” was one of the first things I learned as an analyst at McKinsey & Company. Employing the scientific method, this process allows research teams to work through problems quickly and efficiently. It involves working out an early answer to a problem and then digging into the data to seek to improve and refine it. Central to this approach, however, is holding your hypothesis loosely. If you are too attached to your initial answer, you may refuse to let it go, no matter where the data lead. But if you treat your own answer as a straw man, holding your assumptions loosely, you'll be ready to totally abandon it if the situation demands it.\n\nRank thinks of American poverty as a game of musical chairs. “Social scientists like myself have focused so long on who loses out in the game, but the real issue is why the game produces losers in the first place and how this situation can be addressed,” he observes. “Imagine a game of musical chairs with ten players and eight chairs. When the music stops and players attempt to sit in one of the chairs, those who aren't as quick or are in a bad position lose out. Regardless of who the players are, two of them will end up losers. That's a powerful analogy to use, and it does capture what's happening in the United States.”\n\nWhen the European Union (EU) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012, European Commission president José Manuel Barroso said that European integration has shown “that it is possible for peoples and nations to come together across borders” and “that it is possible to overcome the differences between ‘them’ and ‘us.’” Generalizing about “peoples and nations” in the way Barroso and others do mistakes Europe for the world. European integration since the end of the Second World War has brought peoples and nations together, but only within Europe. Internal barriers to the free movement of capital, goods, and people have been progressively removed, but external barriers have persisted, especially those restricting the movement of people.\n\nAn old favorite question on physics exams asks how to determine the height of a tall building by using a barometer. The expected answer involves air pressure varying with height but I admire those who think laterally, such as the student who suggested attaching the barometer to some string, hanging it off the top of the building, and measuring the length of the string plus the length of the barometer. A second student suggested finding the architect and saying, “If you tell me how tall the building is, I’ll give you this nice barometer.”",
      "The number of people going hungry in the world has increased by 122 million to 735 million since 2019 because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. If current trends continue for longer, about 600 million people will be chronically hungry and starved for the foreseeable future — about 119 million more than if neither of these events had happened. After experiencing a sharp increase from 2019 to 2020, the number of needy people facing hunger globally has stabilized. However, recovery from the pandemic has been uneven, and the war in Ukraine has been a significant factor fueling the ongoing food crisis. This is the “new normal” where climate change, conflict, and economic instability are pushing those on the margins even farther from society.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries. Financial institutions are using AI as they conduct statistical analysis, fraud detection, and risk management. Manufacturers are relying on a wide range of AI programs to optimize their production processes. The trouble is, an advanced AI can pose a risk to human society, as it could be used to develop an autonomous weapon or to begin a cyber attack. Recently, governments around the world are calling for AI regulations. The goal of regulations is not to slow down the growth that the AI sector enjoys today, but to provide a framework that promotes responsible and ethical AI development and use. The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, launched in 2020, underlines a need for developing AI in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure that the public’s trust in the technology is full."
