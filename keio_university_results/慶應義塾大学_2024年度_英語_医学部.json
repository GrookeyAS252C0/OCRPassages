      "For at least 80 days, ever since drought and mismanagement depleted the drinking water supply of my country’s capital, Montevideo, the water that has come out of our taps has tasted of salt and smelled of chemicals. Those of us who can afford bottled water use it for everything. We cook pasta, wash lettuce and make coffee with it, buying more and more plastic water containers that end up in the dump. When we take a shower, we keep it short, and we also keep the windows open because chemical compounds in the steam may be carcinogenic.\n\nAt the high of the crisis, sodium and chloride levels rose to double and triple, respectively, the maximum values by our own national drinking water regulations. People complained of stomach pain and diarrhea. The government warned that children under 2 years of age, pregnant mothers, and people with high blood pressure, kidney failure or heart problems should limit their consumption of the water, or in some cases avoid it altogether.\n\nIn Uruguay, clean water is part of our national identity. School children are taught that the country is blessed with abundant high-quality water, thanks to many large rivers and six great aquifers. For most of our history, we could rely on rain to fill these rivers and aquifers. And in 2004, we became the first country in the world to write access to safe drinking water into the Constitution.\n\nBut the most severe drought in 44 years, coupled with aging infrastructure and serious mismanagement of the Santa Lucia reservoirs, has rewritten that comforting story. Now the metropolitan area around Montevideo and neighboring towns and cities, home to about 60 percent of the nation’s 3.4 million people, are living through the consequences.\n\nThe Santa Lucia River, which provided a steady flow of fresh water to the capital for more than 150 years, has almost disappeared for some stretches. In February, a reservoir that until recently contained up to five billion gallons of water was sucked nearly dry. Another shrank, at one point, to just 2 percent capacity. As the sweet water from Santa Lucia has emptied, the salty water from the Rio de la Plata, an Atlantic Ocean estuary, has seeped into its riverbed. Our main water purification plant doesn’t have the technology to remove the salt, so it enters our pipes, our homes, and our bodies. The government has no plan B for this crisis, which could last another three months. One senator has tweeted that everyone should pray for rain.\n\nAs bad as it is here, Montevideo’s water crisis is not unique. The 2023 U.N. World Water Development Report shows that one in four people around the world lack access to clean water. “We cannot claim surprise at the next drought,” Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, the U.N.’s special rapporteur on human rights and drinking water, told me. “No matter how strong and long it may be, there must be alternative, complementary, supplementary sources,” he said. And there must be a plan to “establish priorities during the emergency.”\n\nLast week, Mr. Arrojo-Agudo told Uruguay that it must favor people over industry and agriculture in providing a clean water supply, as indicated by international human rights standards. The government took issue with his statement, saying that the chemical levels were not as alarming as he claimed and that helpful measures were underway. But the rapporteur knows that similar problems exist all over the world, and that rationing individual people’s access to water while industrial or agricultural use goes unchecked will, as he told me, deplete the water supply even further and generate a greater risk of contamination.\n\nIt’s not just our health that’s at risk. The agricultural sector, which is the largest industry in Uruguay, has suffered losses of about 2 percent of the country’s G.D.P. Six out of 10 of our companies are now facing production issues. Pharma, food, construction, chemical industries: all of them are in a scramble for water, leaving their employees as anxious at work as they are at home.\n\nHow did we get here? Over the last four decades, the nation has allowed the agricultural and mining industries to pollute the Santa Lucia and interrupt its natural cycles. And despite the obvious growth of its population and economy, our country did not construct new drinking water reservoirs, even when the problem started to come into view. Since March 2020, the government has declared several emergencies for agricultural producers, freeing them from having to pay taxes and giving them other benefits. But it waited until June 19 of this year to declare an emergency for the rest of the population.\n\nNow it has to scramble. The government is trying to build reservoirs in some rivers and is planning a plant to desalinate water from the Rio de la Plata, but that is unlikely to come online in the next three years. The public water company recently started operating new wells in the heart of the city, hoping to load tanker trucks with water from an aquifer and distribute it to hospitals.\n\nMany of my neighbors are drilling, too, hoping to find groundwater for their families. One of them showed me the results of a water quality test on some water he extracted. They are scary. His well contained a bacterium associated with blood, lung and other infections. It seems it’s already too late for us to find a way out of this disaster on our own.\n\nWe have had three inches of rain over the last two weeks, which has helped. But local weather patterns remain unpredictable.",
      "forecasts, global climate change and irresponsible land use are all pointing us the same direction. It’s not just Montevideo: Every city in the world needs to start prioritizing its drinking water now, while there’s still half a chance for better outcomes. Water is our most precious resource. Keeping it safe and available must be our first priority.\n\nIn the current situation, even using Montevideo’s tap water to wash may be hazardous to the health. For people with certain health conditions, drinking the tap water can be fatal. The population of Uruguay’s capital city and its surrounding area is about 2 million people. There are six reservoirs along the Santa Lucta River. Around a quarter of the world’s population have a hard time finding adequate supplies of clean water. As soon as the prospect of water shortages in Uruguay became clear, the government invested heavily in reservoir building. One promising solution to the current water shortage is drilling for one’s own water. The recent rain in Montevideo is a good indication that the situation will soon stabilize.",
      "As people across the globe grappled with higher levels of stress, depression and anxiety during the Covid pandemic, many turned to their favorite comfort foods: ice cream, pastries, pizza, hamburgers. But studies in recent years suggest that the sugar-laden and high-fat foods we often crave when we are stressed or depressed, as comforting as they may seem, are the least likely to benefit our mental health. Whole foods such as vegetables, fruit, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, beans, and fermented foods like yogurt may be a better bet.\n\nThe findings stem from an emerging field of research known as nutritional psychiatry, which looks at the relationship between diet and mental wellness. The idea that eating certain foods could promote brain health, much the way it can promote heart health, might seem like common sense. But historically, nutrition research has focused largely on how the foods we eat affect our physical health, rather than our mental health. Various studies have provided intriguing hints over the years about the ways in which foods may affect our mood. A healthy diet promotes a healthy gut, which communicates with the brain through what is known as the gut-brain axis. Microbes in the gut produce neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, which regulate our mood and emotions, and the gut microbiome has been implicated in mental health outcomes. “A growing body of literature shows that the gut microbiome plays a shaping role in a variety of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder,” a team of scientists wrote in the Harvard Review of Psychiatry last year.\n\nLarge population studies have shown that people who eat a lot of nutrient-dense foods report less depression and greater levels of happiness and mental well-being. One such study, from 2016, that followed 12,400 people for about seven years found that those who increased their intake of fruits and vegetables during the study period rated themselves substantially higher on questionnaires about their general levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Large observational studies can show only correlations, not causation, which raises various questions: Which comes first? Are people who are happy and optimistic more motivated to consume nutritious foods? Does a healthy diet directly brighten their moods?\n\nThe first major trial to shed light on the food-mood connection was published in 2017. A team of researchers wanted to know whether dietary changes would help alleviate depression, so they recruited 67 people who were clinically depressed and split them into two groups. One group went to meetings with a dietitian who taught them to follow a traditional Mediterranean-style diet. The other group, serving as the control, met regularly with a research assistant who provided social support but no dietary advice.\n\nAt the start of the study, both groups consumed large quantities of sugary foods, processed meats and salty snacks, and very few fiber-rich foods, lean proteins, fruits or vegetables. But then big changes were made to the diet group’s intake. Candy, fast food and pastries were replaced with whole foods, such as nuts, beans, fruits and legumes. White bread was switched for whole-grain bread. Sugary cereals were exchanged for muesli and oatmeal, and instead of pizza, the diet group ate vegetable stir-fries. They also swapped highly processed meats like ham, sausages and bacon for seafood and small amounts of lean red meats. Importantly, both groups were counseled to continue taking any antidepressants or other medications they were prescribed. The goal of the study was not to see if a healthier diet could replace medication, but whether it would provide additional benefits like spurring study participants to exercise and improve other lifestyle behaviors like sleeping habits.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, average depression scores improved in both groups, which might be expected for anyone entering a clinical trial that provided additional support, regardless of which group they were in. But depression scores improved to a far greater extent in the group that followed the healthy diet: roughly a third of those people were no longer classified as depressed, compared to 8 percent of people in the control group. The results were also striking in showing that the diet benefited mental health even though the participants did not lose any weight. “Mental health is complex,” says Dr. Jacka, the President of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research. “Eating a salad is not going to cure depression. But there’s a lot you can do to lift your mood and improve your mental health.” Individual clinicians like Dr. Drew Ramsey, a psychiatrist and assistant clinical professor at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, concur. “Food can be empowering,” says Dr. Ramsey. “We can’t control our genes, who our parents were, or if random acts of trauma or violence happen to us. But we can control how we eat, and that gives people actionable things that they can do to take care of their brain health on a daily basis.”",
