      "Workers are revolting. Amazingly, people across every economic sector are choosing to quit stable jobs in unprecedented numbers, leaving many businesses unable to function. Some workers demand higher salaries, some want to improve their education, and others are simply taking some “me” time. What can be done to bring back these workers and how can we improve their working conditions? The answer is simple: remote work.\n\nRemote work is a way of working where employees do not commute to a designated office building. Of course, remote work has existed for decades. It was first termed “telecommuting” by Jack Niles in the 1970s. Niles claimed the barriers to its implementation were not technological but social in nature: it was stubborn managers and outdated organizational schemes that kept employees tied to their desks. Certainly, its recent rise has been enabled by advances in communications technologies and personal computers. Ironically, however, it was a virus that spurred the remote work revolution in 2020.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic produced lockdowns affecting many countries until 2022. For the financial year 2020, this resulted in a contraction of the world economy by 3.3%, accompanied by a sharp wave of lay-offs. However, the following year, despite difficulties in accurately measuring economic activity in those countries where restrictions were still in place, surprisingly global growth seems to have reached 5.8%. Economic numbers generally improved and, with a few notable exceptions, the governments and corporations best able to weather the storm were those that quickly adopted remote work policies.\n\nThe benefits from remote work are felt by companies and workers alike, with none more important than cost saving. For employees, going to the workplace incurs costs for travel, lunch, work clothing, and hidden expenses like gifts for colleagues’ birthdays. Parents working at home may benefit by saving on childcare. At the same time, remote work reduces the need for office space. Savings may be found on rent, utilities, cleaning, furniture, as well as reduced allowances for travel and housing.\n\nThese ideas were best expressed by Seymour Dolhers of Bildemup, a construction firm in Cambridge: “Remote work is a win-win for everyone,” Dolhers said. When the pandemic hit, the company closed their headquarters and moved their office workers online. “The first thing we did was get rid of our previous method that required documents to be passed around the office for approval,” Dolhers explained. For Bildemup, putting everything online increased operations and flexibility for employees, none of whom have yet to quit. It also allowed the business to take on new projects far from their previous headquarters, as personnel are able to work from anywhere.\n\nOne of the lingering fears about remote work is that employees will be less productive when they are away from the office environment. This may have been justified in the past, but most work today can be done with a laptop and an internet connection. Working remotely allows employees to find the best environment for themselves, whether at home, at a local café, on the top of a mountain, or at a sunny beach. With no stress or time wasted commuting, workers are happier and more productive.\n\nIt increases freedom and improves job satisfaction, allows workers to live anywhere they like, and improves work-life balance. It reduces harmful office politics, improves loyalty, and reduces absences. Among these benefits, one of the less well-noted is its impact on the environment. With the lockdowns during the pandemic, the residents of large cities marveled at the clearing skies, quiet roadways, and never-so-clean rivers and lakes. While remote work is only partially responsible for these improvements, one can easily see how it reduces greenhouse gasses and energy consumption.\n\nSome people worry about the broader impacts of the remote work revolution. They claim it will negatively impact building owners as companies give up their leases, or it will run local restaurants out of business. However, from San Francisco to Manhattan, urban centers in the United States have experienced lower rents for residential and commercial spaces, which has allowed for new, diverse usage of this prime real estate. Certainly, remote work has deeply impacted the restaurant industry, but that is not entirely negative: the pressures have forced restaurants to improve customers’ dining experience in surprising ways, and to increase take-out and delivery options.\n\nThe remote work revolution will continue to change how corporations are run. When companies meet the needs and expectations of their employees for remote work environments, they will be rewarded with loyal employees equipped to do better work. No longer tied to commuting routes and stale office spaces, workers may improve the quality of their lives and, in turn, the wider communities they live in.",
      "The Dark Side of Remote Work Remote work is a danger, not only to us individually, but to the very fabric of modern life. How we work is central to how we interact with others and function as a society. In the past, hunter gatherers lived in small tribes and moved over great distances to search for food. Farmers created large families and social networks that collaborated during planting and harvesting seasons. Recently, the Industrial Revolution has brought people into dense urban centers, the growth of culturally rich cities like New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo. If we take office work away from these cities, what will be left of them? Working remotely became a reality for many in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and at first it all seemed so attractive. Businesses and employees welcomed it, as it kept the economy moving. Worker productivity skyrocketed, with reported increases ranging from 13% to as high as 56%. Workers reported exercising more, finding new hobbies, and spending more time with family members. But was this all an illusion? Today, few are deceived. Companies who dreamed of increased worker productivity have found the benefits to be overstated. Many firms no longer trust their employees’ self-reported data. For workers, disillusionment has also set in: today, they realize that employers are happy to allow remote work because the boundary between work and private life becomes blurred. Work-at-home employees are expected to take conference calls, even though they may be driving their kids to soccer practice or helping them with homework. As far as increased productivity is concerned, it has simply been a product of more hours working.\n\nIn their quest for more productive hours from remote work, companies fail to see the long-term impacts on the quality of work. The first stems from the rise of supervision. Employees work more quickly, not more intelligently, because companies evaluate remote workers simply for the time it takes them to complete tasks or respond to emails. The second is a product of working at home, which over time stifles innovation. Employees are no longer free to chat with colleagues or exchange ideas with people they meet from outside their immediate working groups. Spontaneous encounters are essential to the emergence of new ideas. Ultimately, they are key to the growth and education of quality workers as well as the development of a healthy company culture.\n\nA survey in 2021 found 70% of people reported a positive view of remote work, claiming benefits for one’s health, interpersonal relationships, and finances. In the same survey, however, 24% of respondents reported stressed relationships at home and 54% identified the lack of workspace as negatively impacting work-life balance. Alarmingly, while 10.4% cited improved mental health as one of the top three things they liked about remote work, one in five of all respondents reported new mental health issues. This is due to the isolation and anxiety from the lack of interaction with colleagues and supervisors. Most worryingly, when looking only at the younger employees and those who live alone, this reported rate of mental health problems almost doubled.\n\nThe harmful effects of remote work are visible everywhere. On the one hand, with people no longer compelled to live in cities, businesses have ceased trading, and art museums, symphony halls, and other cultural institutions no longer have many visitors. This forces urban governments and resident groups to either fund them or let them fold. On the other hand, over the past two years remote workers have flooded into rural towns and villages. This has been truly disastrous for those communities, since the unexpected wave of new residents has caused severe problems across the entire community: for schools, roads, hospitals, police, and other government services. These problems are compounded when corporations employing remote workers are based in, and thus pay taxes to, different cities or states.\n\nThe idea that remote work is beneficial to the environment is a fantasy. For example, the energy costs of operating a single office for a hundred workers exceed what it takes to run a hundred home offices. Workers boast about the CO2 reduction with no more daily hour-long commutes to work. But when they move to remote areas, they simply exchange this for hour-long drives to the supermarket or home center. Moreover, with people building new homes on large farmsteads or remote forested hills, they are not only damaging these landscapes but also preventing them from being used to produce food and other resources.\n\nSomebody needs to intervene: whether that means individuals through their actions as consumers, or the government through public policy. Left alone, companies and employees are both seemingly willing to let things get out of hand. Take Meta for example. It started as a company that revolutionized the world by making it easier to keep in touch, plan events, and meet like-minded people. Today, they are trying to push everyone into a virtual world where people will conduct all their work and amusement activities. Is this really the future we want? Indeed, do we want this at the cost of our cultural institutions, social relationships, and our mental health?",
      "Media Literacy: A Vaccine Against Disinformation?\n\nThe availability of information online and the spread of social media have radically changed our exposure to disinformation. “Fake news”, a phrase few had heard of before the 2016 US presidential election, has now become a catchphrase for politicians everywhere. Disinformation can take many forms, but at heart it can be the harmful intentions of its creators to spread material they know to be false.\n\nTo be sure, a limited amount of disinformation has always been with us. Even in Greek and Roman times, politicians spread false rumors hoping to gain advantages. Furthermore, falsehoods spread in the name of commerce have characterized much of the private sector since the Middle Ages. Before the arrival of mass media, harmful gossip could easily spread inside poor, rural communities, resulting in many forms of injustice.\n\nCertainly, the arrival of the internet has been a game-changer. Today, our willingness to believe things which are not true, or to accept ideas without due reflection has never been more pronounced. Much of what we see or hear digitally is brought to us by computer algorithms, which create cognitive bias. Instead of being exposed to a variety of perspectives, we live increasingly in echo chambers where people are exposed to content containing similar, ever more extreme opinions. Indeed, as online disinformation videos attract an increasing number of views, they often become viral. This tends to confer a special kind of legitimacy, which is difficult to counter. In the US, the persistence of the falsehoods spread by the QAnon cult is evidence of the trend. QAnon continues to be mentioned in the media as legitimate popular opinion, even though many prominent believers have abandoned them.\n\nThe consequences of disinformation should never be underestimated. On a national scale, political disagreements have led not simply to increased falsehoods, but to violence. At a more local level, false rumors have been shown to be the source of riots. Furthermore, the erosion of trust has begun to weaken people’s faith in democratic systems. False claims that elections were stolen, for example, tend to erode public trust in the system of governance itself. Political disinterest is a modern disease, but the source of the problem is often a sense of despair amongst voters — brought on by a lack of faith in any official narrative.\n\nIronically, the idea of promoting fair and unbiased debate has itself contributed to the spread of disinformation. Modern media’s love affair with skepticism and its encouragement of debate has allowed views contrary to established consensus to flourish, even when the science is overwhelmingly against them. People who claim that the earth is flat gain the undeserved chance to argue their “case”, and vaccine skeptics are given media exposure, even with little or no evidence to support their claims. Even in educational institutions, actively promoting debate can also have unintended consequences, when some students conclude that all sources of information are equally suspect.\n\nHow should we respond to this situation? Some have advocated mass censorship, attempting to control what can or cannot appear on the internet, and controlling the content of school textbooks, for example, so as to present a single acceptable version of the world. The problem with this approach, however, is that when governments monopolize what they decide to be the truth, they wind up with mass disinformation projects of their own. Accordingly, people in totalitarian societies become skeptics, often regarding the official story with suspicion. Thus, the problem remains.\n\nReform of the media seems like a plausible solution, but is tricky to achieve. Take social media companies for example. Attempts by national governments to control them have faced challenges. Progress has been limited, since these companies, though cooperative, often have a built-in resistance to the idea of balanced information streams. Partly, that is due to the technical problem of how to police their own sites, partly it stems from a competitive business model where sharing even distorted information is a source of revenue. Rather, it may be that we have to live with disinformation as a problem, in the same way, sadly, that we have to live with viral infections. In this case, we need to “vaccinate” as many children and adults as possible. In short, give them the necessary tools to fight off becoming infected with false information. Doing that requires educated citizens, who can think critically: that is to say, citizens who can question, analyze, and make judgments about such information as they encounter. Media literacy classes for adults, including classes which examine the nature of social media, are necessary, and in exceptional circumstances even national governments should take steps to make sure they are adopted.\n\nMedia literacy has been on the agenda of many nations for some time now, but it is needed today more than ever before. Addressing the spread of disinformation is complex; this is no quick fix. At the end of the day, however, leaving the ultimate say on what to believe in the hands of well-educated citizens, not politicians or business leaders, may be the best defense against disinformation that we possess.",
