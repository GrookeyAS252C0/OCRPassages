      "At Sport is not simply about who wins or loses the game. While events on the field of play may define the limits of the actual physical sporting experience, the impact of sport is felt far wider. In 1950, for example, Brazil was the host nation, and hot favourite, for that year’s soccer World Cup. They faced Uruguay in the final, in front of 200,000 supporters. The Uruguayans silenced the home crowd, scoring the winning goal, with 11 minutes remaining, to win 2-1. In trying to explain the shock of the defeat for Brazilians, the writer Nelson Rodriguez noted, ‘Every nation has its own irredeemable catastrophe, something like Hiroshima. Our catastrophe, our Hiroshima, was the defeat by Uruguay in 1950.’ The comparison, while trying to capture the psychological effect on Brazilian pride, is ridiculous in terms of the human cost. Rodriguez was trying to make the point, albeit insensitively, that in moments such as these sport can profoundly affect people’s lives and expose the frailties of the national consciousness.\n\nAs schoolchildren, spectators, players, or simply as consumers of media, we are all exposed to sport every day. Given the ethical values that were enshrined in the origins of modern sport, the constant valorization of fair play and sportsmanship by contemporary sports organizations and the media, the games we play and watch are supposed to be ‘good’ things. However, sport has always had its dark side. Many of the ills apparent in society have historically manifested themselves in and around sport and, considering the media, have been magnified.\n\nIn his essay entitled Germany and its Tribes, Roman historian Tacitus provides a painstaking description of Rome's enemies to the north. A good indicator of how Romans viewed their northern neighbors, the essay portrays Germanic barbarians as a sort of noble savage — courageous in battle but totally unappreciative of the finer things in life; religious in custom but incapable of higher thinking; dirty and smelly but hospitable and honest.\n\nA modern historian expressed the Roman view of barbarians as people who “did not have a history but were simply part of the flow of natural history.” That is, unlike the “civilized” Greeks and Romans, barbarians didn’t make history; history happened to them, as it does to, say, monkeys and apes. This depiction of the barbarians has remained generally intact for more than two millennia.\n\nAnother mistake made about Germanic barbarians over the ages has been the tendency to group all tribes together on the assumption that barbarians were all the same. Tacitus and his contemporaries — and, by extension, we in the present era — tend to speak of barbarians as a single group, when in fact northern European tribes, although holding many similarities, maintained certain differences in terms of religious practice, social customs, burial rites, and political practices.\n\nJust prior to and during the Migration Period (300-700 A.D.), which marks the height of the northern tribes’ incursion into the Roman Empire and beyond, the divide among tribes became even sharper. Different tribes had different goals regarding the Roman Empire, but the Goths stood out from the rest in their eagerness to attain peace with the Romans and gain acceptance into the Empire.",
      "Some mammals (whales, dolphins, fur seals, sea lions) sleep with one hemisphere of the brain being asleep while the other is awake. This is referred to as unihemispheric slow-wave sleep (USWS) and contrasts with the bihemispheric slow-wave sleep (BSWS) exhibited by humans and other mammals. Whales and dolphins show only USWS. Northern fur seals and sea lions are aquatic and terrestrial. While in water these animals have USWS, like whales, but on land they have both USWS and BSWS. It is unclear whether whales, like humans, have rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas we know that seals and sea lions have REM sleep on land, and it is always bilateral. Some birds also have USWS, but neurochemicals related to USWS have only been measured in the fur seal. The evolutionary basis of USWS is unclear. The discovery of unihemispheric sleep is a boon to sleep research as it provides a unique opportunity to empirically test neural circuit models of sleep-wake regulation.\n\nAll biographies are interpretations of their subjects. The best biographers compose accounts that make use of every possible resource of representation that narrative can offer. They are concerned with a judicious presentation of the facts of a life but also, much more important, with devising a form, a style, an attitude, and a perspective that can come as close as a book may do to paralleling the life of its subject. If this is done well enough, the book can truly resemble the man or woman it is describing.\n\nThe biographer is the life’s second author or, perhaps, its editor. A biography of John Dewey demands that its author represent Dewey as and how he lived. Because Dewey’s main occupation in life was thinking, his biographer must not only write about Dewey’s thought but also reflect and inquire with Dewey into the processes of thinking. Dewey’s main entry into the life of thought was through his emotions. He was not a thinking machine but a vibrant person-who-thought. His biographer can succeed only if he, too, conveys in his own narrative the continuous activity of Dewey's strong emotions.\n\nDewey was one person. But he prepared many faces to meet the opportunities offered by both his own inner capacities and the possibilities of his time and place. For philosophers, he was a philosopher, immensely learned and technically brilliant. For those people engaged with issues of education, whether experts in the field or anguished parents, he was the leading exponent of the new learning. For the citizenry, he was an advocate and combatant in the rough-and-tumble of American politics, public affairs, and public policy, as well as a powerful controversialist for liberal causes. Dewey moved effortlessly from any one of these roles to the others.",
      "As Stephen of Hungary counselled his successor in the eleventh century, ‘The utility of foreigners and guests is so great that they can be given a place of sixth importance among the royal ornaments’.\n\nEnglish, as seen by those who did not acquire it as a mother tongue, has been characterized in an astonishing variety of ways: unimportant, invasive, empowering, destructive are among the words used to describe it.\n\nFourteenth-century texts are unique in that they reveal a complex interface of languages.\n\nIn recognizing that the past is often like the present, we need to search backwards for evidence of this process of accommodation.\n\nModern multilinguals look with surprise on those who believe that a single language will serve them better than several.\n\nOld English already had a word for the crucial social role of the translator — wealhsiod — who stood at the interface of two languages.\n\nOld-fashioned language histories have often endeavoured to look at a ‘national’ language as if it were a single ‘and triumphant’ result of some Darwinian process of selection.\n\nThe Bible, for example, relates a linguistic miracle that took place in the first century AD when the followers of Jesus suddenly became fluent in the languages of the many visitors to and residents of Jerusalem.\n\nMultilingualism is, and has been, a normal part of social life for most people, both now and in the past. They can hardly imagine so isolated an existence as implied by one language or barely believe that monolinguals can be satisfied by talking to people identical, more or less, to themselves.\n\nEnglish is and has been one language among many. The ebb and flow of enthusiasm for other languages within the anglophone community is a tale of profound cultural importance for the history of English. Yet both sides of the linguistic divide are important. In Britain, abroad has been seen as sometimes repugnant, sometimes frightening — ‘that beastly abroad’, wrote one nineteenth-century novelist quoted by the Oxford English Dictionary. Mistrust and suspicion is not the exclusive property of English-speakers, however.\n\nIn the past, heightened social value accrued around the possession of more languages than one. This involved no fewer than fifteen languages. The surprise was the clarity of the speech of those miraculously made fluent, a startling improvement on the halting approximations or pidgin contact languages which had been usual in that multilingual city. Even if this story is regarded as metaphorical rather than historical, it presumes a culture in which a diversity of languages is entirely normal. Moreover, he added, ‘a country unified in language and customs is fragile and weak’. Stephen’s view seems to have been commonplace in political thinking at the time that English emerged as a distinct language within the cluster of West Germanic dialects. Bede began his Ecclesiastical History of the English Peoples by describing the linguistic riches of eighth-century Britain and celebrating the fact that five languages were in use. Until quite recently, the prevailing opinion has been the more languages, the better.\n\nThis view ignores the abundance of languages and language varieties except insofar as they were swept up and carried forward by the inevitable rise of the national ‘standard’. More recently, approaches to the ‘ecology’ of communities have instead demonstrated the value of describing the facts of language life for all people living in earlier times and places. People at the interface of two (or more) languages ‘accommodate’ to each other and thus create new linguistic identities. Twenty-first-century society is not so different to those of earlier times. The many languages of Manchester or Miami, Cape Town or Canberra, can easily be matched in the much smaller settlements of medieval Colchester or renaissance Cardiff. In all of these communities, a dynamic interaction among languages and dialects produced new forms of expression.\n\nBefore written records became common, it is difficult to discern just what balance among languages might have been struck in the early history of the British Isles. Place-names can still attest the kinds of linguistic layering which often took place. London, for example, traces its own history into English from the Latin Londinium, which is itself supposed to be based on a Celtic personal or tribal name, Londinos. Complex multilingualism was prevalent in Anglo-Saxon England. In Middle English too, multilingualism remained a significant fact about language use in Britain even though, following the Norman Conquest, the individual language components of such multilingualism had decisively changed.",
      "Good heavens! Are you a ghost from the world beyond? Indeed, I am. And what, pray tell, are you doing out at this late hour? You must agree that it is a fine night for a stroll. Isn’t that why you've wandered out here? I'm searching for some insights with which to contemplate the nature of existence. In that case, please don’t let me get in your way. I shall retire to the church. Well, come to think of it, I could benefit from your insights. Stay with me a while. As you wish. Now, tell me, what aspect of existence most puzzles you? It’s all this talk of fate, of destiny, and their supposed influence over our future. Nonsense, all of it! It is the ever-changing combination of accidental circumstances and the fickle operation of free will which determines one’s future — nothing more. And am I simply to wait for it? Or have you some conclusive evidence? Why, I’m a ghost, am I not? I possess supernatural understanding of a wide variety of things. Prove it. Well, I happen to know that you will live to be ninety-eight years old. You have no choice. You're contradicting yourself! Then it’s just as I feared: fate presides over our future. You may be right, after all.\n\nDiversity is sometimes given a worse reputation than it deserves. Certain people insist that the term signifies nothing more than difference, and so to call ourselves diverse is to separate ourselves, to undermine community. How unfortunate, especially in a democracy, that we fail to note how insistently diversity also points to unity. When we call Americans diverse, we are saying they are all Americans, equal members of the category. Like democracy, diversity encourages us to establish a unifying context, a community of meaning and action in which individual differences can thrive and strengthen the community that nurtures them. However, opponents of diversity in higher education often argue that it denies opportunity to deserving individuals just to make room for those less qualified. But the facts contradict the argument and demonstrate that American higher education has typically accommodated newcomers by enrolling larger numbers of students. As a result, those who had previously been disproportionately privileged — white, upper-class, male students — suffered no real disadvantage. At the end of the twentieth century at Wesleyan University, an elite institution in the United States, for example, there were more white male students than there were in 1956. In the 1990s, some students were stunned by such statistics, but not because they were unfamiliar with the institution's recent commitment to diversity — many had applied for that reason. Rather, they had never considered the possibility that admission to the university might have been out of reach for their own parents.\n\nDespite some negative views about diversity, in reality ..."
