      "Most salamanders live in streams and under rocks or logs, but the wandering salamander (Aneides vagrans) has a high-flying lifestyle. These 13-centimeter-long amphibians spend much or all of their lives in coastal redwoods, some of the tallest trees in the world. Now, a laboratory study shows how they can descend by jumping, slowing their fall by spreading their limbs like a skydiver.\n\nTo study the aerial ability of the wandering salamander, researchers brought several individuals into the lab along with three other species that vary in how well they climb. They put them into a wind tunnel with a fan blowing upward to simulate the animal falling. Both the wandering salamander and its relative, the arborcal salamander (A. lugubris), often spread their limbs like a skydiver in freefall, maximizing drag. This slowed their descent by as much as 10%, the researchers report today in Current Biology. Other times, the salamanders glided and turned in various directions by wiggling their legs and tail. In contrast, the speckled black salamander (A. flavipunctatus), which isn’t known for its climbing ability, and the ground-dwelling Monterey ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii), at best sometimes managed to glide but without much control.\n\nSkydiving could be an effective way to avoid predators. It might also be a more efficient way of moving down the tree. The researchers are now studying the flight behavior with computer models to figure out how wandering salamanders — which have no obvious adaptations for flight, such as flaps of skin — generate lift to help them glide.\n\nScientists have observed that babies and toddlers show a strong preference for sweet tastes. This preference was once an evolutionary advantage. Sugar from fruit or honey was a quick source of complex carbohydrates. And fruit that was sweet and ripe gave a person more nutritional value.\n\nThe preference for sweet foods diminishes in late adolescence. And older teens and people in their early twenties discover they no longer care for sugary bubblegum or sweet strawberry drops. As we age, however, we become less reliant on a food item’s taste profile. Our memory and perception enable us to try, and even like, new food items. “As we grow and get exposed to different flavors, there is a lot of learning going on. We associate different tastes with different consequences,” says Nancy E. Rawson with the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. A person, for example, might learn that bitter tastes aren’t harmful and that Brussels sprouts are indeed delightful when tossed with a bacon dressing. This can prompt a person to try more bitter tastes. Conversely, feeling ill after devouring a grease-blotted taquito can prompt a person to avoid such foods in the future. This evolving palate, Rawson says, allows a person to adapt to environmental changes, in which certain foods might be unavailable or new foods are introduced. “Our senses are remarkable. They are constantly changing throughout our life,” Rawson says. “This allows the system to react to the environment so it can stimulate the right kind of behavior.” Similar to how our skin cells replenish less robustly as we age, Rawson says our taste cells also diminish as we age. For women, taste cells begin atrophying and reducing in number after age forty. For men, the change starts in their fifties. The sense of smell also dwindles as a person ages. Much of a flavor’s sensation comes from the aroma, and losing this sense can diminish a person’s pleasure. These changes, however, are gradual and not significant. Rawson says a person can adapt and enjoy tasting food and eating throughout their older years. The problem is when certain medications interrupt taste cells.",
      "A water and electric utility in central California will install a first-of-its-kind network of solar panels on water canals. Turlock Irrigation District (TID) has secured a $20 million grant from the state to pursue the first-in-the-nation project, which could serve a beneficial double whammy: create renewable energy and save some water in the process.\n\nA lot of water in California wends its way through the state’s 4,000 miles of open delivery canals that comprise the aqueduct system, transporting water supply from the Sierra Nevada mountains and northern parts of the state to reservoirs, lakes, hydropower plants, and farms. The water supply in the state is already under serious dual threats from overuse and climate change, so every drop counts. And these exposed canals have a serious flaw: They allow some of that precious water to evaporate.\n\nCovering all the canals in the state with solar panels, last year’s analysis found, could save 63 billion gallons of water annually — about the amount needed to irrigate 50,000 acres of farmland or to supply 2 million people with their water needs. Those panels, the study’s authors calculated, could supply 13 gigawatts of solar energy, about a sixth of the state’s total energy needs. The water's cooling effect, in turn, could help keep those solar panels working more effectively, since solar panels lose some efficiency on very hot days.\n\nFiguring out how to maximize space around and under solar arrays is nothing new. There's a growing practice known as agrivoltaics that seeks to elevate solar panels on farmland to allow agricultural activity to still occur, while floating solar panels have been deployed in places like Japan and Singapore. But constructing solar panels as a protection measure for irrigation canals is a new idea. It won't fix the West’s serious water use problems or the mounting threat climate change poses to water supply, but it does represent the kind of creative solution California needs to explore as it stares down a water-scarce future. “A lot of water gets evaporated just because we don't put a lid on it,” Brandi McKuin, the paper’s lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at University of California, Santa Cruz, told Gizmodo last year.\n\nChanging what you eat could add up to 13 years to your life, according to a newly published study, especially if you start when you are young. The study created a model of what might happen to a man or woman’s longevity if they replaced a “typical Western diet” focused on red meat and processed foods with an “optimized diet” focused on eating less red and processed meat and more fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts.\n\nIf a woman began eating optimally at age 20, she could increase her lifespan by just over 10 years, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine. A man eating the healthier diet from age 20 could add 13 years to his life. Focusing on a healthier diet could also lengthen the lives of older adults, the study said. By starting at age 60, a woman could still increase her lifespan by eight years. Men starting a healthier diet at age 60 might add nearly nine years to their lives. A plant-based eating style could even benefit 80-year-olds, the study said: Men and women could gain about 3.5 years of extra life from dietary changes. “The notion that improving diet quality would reduce the risk of chronic disease and premature death is long established, and it only stands to reason that less chronic disease and premature death means more life expectancy,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\nKatz, the president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. “What they define as an ‘optimal’ diet is not quite optimal; it’s just a whole lot better than ‘typical,’” Katz said, adding that he felt the diet could be “further improved, conferring even greater benefits. My impression is that their ‘much improved’ diet still allowed for considerable doses of meat and dairy,” Katz said.",
      "Focus on plant-based foods over meat and processed foods. Increase plant-based foods, decrease meat and processed foods. Replace meat with fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains and nuts. Shift emphasis from red meat to fruits and vegetables.\n\nBecause a misunderstanding between a pilot and an air traffic controller can lead to catastrophe, the formation of a common language has made flying much safer. You might be surprised to learn that if you're taking an airline flight from a U.S. airport to some international destination — regardless of whether it’s Paris, Bogota or Beijing — your pilot will be talking to controllers on the ground in those countries in the same language, English. But it’s not a version of English that would make much sense to you, the passenger, since it’s laden with numbers, acronyms and arcane terminology, such as “Center Control, Papa November tree-niner-fife at tree-tree-zero.” The reason is that according to a set of standards and recommended practices adopted in 2003 by the International Civil Aviation Organization, pilots on international flights and air traffic controllers on their routes are required to speak a specialized version of the language known as Aviation English when they communicate over the radio.\n\nHow pilots communicate has evolved since they first began using radios in the early 1900s, according to Dominique Estival, a Western Sydney University linguist and co-author of the book “Aviation English: A lingua franca for pilots and air traffic controllers.” Initially, they used the Q Code, a sort of simplified version of Morse code, and eventually, took to speaking the letters rather than tapping them out. Between the World Wars, pilots began using the International Telecommunications Union's phonetic alphabet, in which a code word was assigned to each letter — such as “alpha” for A, and “bravo” for B — to avoid having someone mishear a letter.\n\nAviation English doesn’t have anywhere near as many words and phrases as the version of the language that most of us speak, but in some ways it’s much more complex and nuanced. Because a misunderstanding between a pilot and a controller can lead to catastrophe, Aviation English relies upon a standard phraseology, which Estival defines in an email as “a prescribed, highly constrained set of phrases to be used insofar as possible.” As a 2014 Aerosavvy.com article explains, even the pronunciation of numbers should follow precise standards for optimum clarity, so that the number four, for example, is spoken as “FOW-cr,” while three becomes “tree” without the ‘h’ sound.\n\nThere's a bit of debate about the origin of the phrase, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Some believe it’s a proverb coined by the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius; others say it’s a modern turn of phrase invented by the advertising industry at the turn of the 20th century. But no matter its origin, the phrase begs a question: If art can express more than the words, then why was the alphabet ever invented? And the answer to that question still remains a bit of a head scratcher.\n\nWriting is a relatively recent invention in human history, developed only about 5,000 years ago. For tens of thousands of years before that, history was largely handed down orally. “The creation of writing is the event that gave humanity a history,” says Lydia Wilson in the new BBC documentary, “The Secret History of Writing.” Wilson is a research associate at the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge and a visiting scholar at the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at City University of New York. “What prompted our ancestors to start writing things down, not for the ear, but for the eye?” she asks.\n\nArchaeologists have taught us that before the alphabet was invented, “written” communication was in the form of pictures, known as hieroglyphics. They are believed to have originated around 3100 BCE, not as a way to capture history, but as a method for documenting business transactions during the rise of the city-state. Scholars believe that Mesopotamia, considered the “Cradle of Civilization,” is the birthplace of many history-changing inventions and concepts, including writing.\n\nBut hieroglyphics were complicated to read and it’s believed that only a small group of scribes was able to decipher the thousands of images that represented specific words. While it’s not clear exactly when or how, researchers say sometime in the second millennium — between 1900 and 1700 BCE — an alphabetic system was developed that enabled more people to read and write.",
      "represented something that someone could recognize but at the same time that sign could be used just for the sound of the thing it looked like, so the sound became drawn out or separated from the picture,” says Irving Finkle of the British Museum in the documentary. “And, this giant leap was rather simple and it’s something which could have occurred to a child, but nevertheless is of great lasting significance.” Robert was known for his outlandish stories so we took what he said with a grain of salt. The information I provided in the application is accurate to the best of my knowledge. Due to an unexpected turn of events, the theater intern was asked to perform in the play. Taro set off for Boston to start a new job in the publishing business. The reclusive author avoided being in the limelight in order to protect his privacy. Some emerging Asian countries have come to the fore during the recent trade talks. You're likely to spoil your child by giving him everything he wants. Employers should compensate their employees for any injuries in the workplace. Daniel was just about to leave the house when he remembered he left the stove on. The inattentive parents didn’t realize their child was out of control and running around the store. John saved his money bit by bit until he was finally able to buy a new car. Maria wanted to lose weight, so she vowed to abstain from sweets and exercise daily. Ichiro was excited to be behind the wheel of his brand-new plug-in hybrid car.
