      "Anti-nuclear movements become prominent features of advanced industrial societies in the 1970s as the use of nuclear power with electricity generation expanded. The act of recounting what have happened introduces a degree of ambiguity into history because different perspectives create different histories. Given the constant and cumulative nature of microaggressions, it’s important to find outside help, especially if there’s a power imbalance or if push back puts you at risk or in danger.\n\nAlong with the promotion of higher wages and skill development, the “Respect for Diversity and Flexibility of Choice” policy calls for the creation of an environment which people can work regardless of their gender and ensure flexibility. It takes work to unlearn the many fraught words and phrases in our cultural lexicon, but most people find it’s not that difficult to do once they set their minds to actively being more inclusive.\n\nAmong international relations scholars, there has been many debate on the consequences of the end of the Cold War for war and peace in the international system. The post-9/11 challenge to sovereignty is organized and led by a hegemonic state which is seeking simultaneous to safeguard and limit Westphalian sovereignty to suit its particular interests. No biologist has ever been able to provide a satisfactory definition of “race” — that is, a definition that includes all members of a given race and excludes all others. Meanwhile, the world’s existing production capacity of both oil and gas are already close to being fully used. Such quandaries might suggest that ethical issues should be left to other social scientists, but that division of labour would be untenable.",
      "Several studies show communication skills are the most essential skills for navigating American adult life — better communicators are hired more often, enjoy happier relationships and marriages, ascend to leadership positions, and possess higher self-esteem. The ability to manage personal emotions and to recognize them in others is a predictor of academic and professional success.\n\nThese skills are often taught through Social Emotional Learning programs, offered in K-12 schools in 27 states. But they are also a by-product of theater class, according to a recent study from George Mason University and the Commonwealth Theatre Center. The study follows children aged 5 to 18 over six years — the longest look at theater’s impact on kids to date — and finds increases in communication skills across age, gender, and race. “The longer the kids spent in the theater classes, the more they gained in 21st century skills, like communication, creativity, imagination, problem solving, and collaboration,” says Thalia Goldstein, the study’s co-author and an associate professor of applied developmental psychology at George Mason University.\n\nTheater involves “active learning” — getting up on your feet to take in information, rather than merely passively absorbing it. “When you put something in your body, it’s more durable, it lasts longer, and you remember it longer,” says Kathryn Dawson, associate professor of theater at the University of Texas at Austin. And theater involves more than one “mode”: verbalizing, while making a gesture or expression, which research shows boosts brain activity.\n\nIt’s something parents, whether they realize it or not, are surrounded by. Parents of young children are familiar with pretend play — the couch is suddenly a frog castle, the floor a lake, and unbeknown to you, sharks are circling your ankles. It may seem like pure fantasy, but in fact, pretend play is the foundation for developing empathy, Goldstein says. It helps young children build emotional understanding, regulation and executive function, the foundational skills that later predict empathy levels. Parents can help foster empathy in children by introducing fiction books throughout childhood, with varied characters, settings, and authors, which correlates directly to empathy scores in adulthood. They can let them be the drivers of pretend play, authors of their own stories.\n\nAnd theater class is yet another way. It’s the social dynamic of theater, the give and take, the volley of listening and responding, that expands kids’ capacity to read cues, think quickly and creatively, work as an ensemble and see things from another perspective. Theater provides an awareness of space, pausing, waiting for somebody else to talk.\n\nFor children with autism, improv techniques increase eye attention and reciprocity of conversation, says Lisa Sherman, co-founder of Act As If, a communications program that specializes in working with autistic youths. And this is where the arts level the playing field for children of different abilities; they can participate in meaningful ways where language is not a requisite skill.\n\nA study among K-2 children in San Diego showed that participating in activities in drama and creative movement significantly improved English-speaking skills among children from primarily Spanish-speaking homes. Children with the most limited English benefited the most, says the study’s co-author, Christa Greenfader, an assistant professor of child and adolescent studies at California State University at Fullerton.\n\nDuring the 2021-2022 school year, more than 4,000 immigrant youths enrolled in public schools in Montgomery County in Maryland, the majority from Central and South America. On a recent Tuesday, Hilda Tijerina, a teaching artist, held a map before a class of 18 teenagers. This was Sharon Faber’s “Theater Class for Emergent English Learners” at Watkins Mill High School, one of 27 classrooms in nine schools where Imagination Stage, a theater arts organization, hosts workshops called “Oyeme!” (“Hear Me!”). Most of the teenagers had arrived in the United States within the year. They spoke little English and were there to express themselves. They sat stoically. “Where are we?” Faber asked the class. “Ddénde?” Tijerina translated, pointing at the map. “In Maryland!” a smattering of students answered. Then Tijerina asked the teenagers to rise from their desks and form a circle. Those who liked what she said were to walk to the center, while saying a sentence in English. “Who likes sports?” she asked. “I like sports!” most of the class called back, gathering in the middle. “Who likes high school?” she called out again. Half called back, “I like high school!” as she corrected their pronunciations.\n\nElvis, 17, arrived from El Salvador six months ago and said theater exercises helped him remember English words for days of the week, months, and numbers. For Brissya, 14, improv allowed her to practice English with classmates. She moved to the next activity, illustrating on a white page what she would do with $1 million. Beside a drawing of a shirt and pants, she wrote “buy some clothes” in English.\n\nConnecting is ultimately the goal of communication, and it is the reason the actor Alan Alda began using improv exercises with scientists. Scientists are trained to speak methodically, defend their arguments and use niche jargon, a communication style that doesn’t always land with a general audience, says Laura Lindenfeld, executive director of the Alda Center for Communicating Science.",
      "Through improv, they are taught to make mistakes and laugh about it, to “give ourselves permission to fail and move on.” “When scientists come into a room, they’re like, ‘Oh man, you’re going to put me through improv?’” she says. But after exercises like “the mirror,” looking intently into other people’s eyes, they realize they can’t succeed unless they’re in touch with the other person. Speaking becomes about making a human connection rather than pushing information — and that’s the point. You may have the most wonderful scientific finding, but if no one understands it, what’s the point? Sara Williams, mother to Charlotte, cites theater as the foundation for her daughter’s self-awareness. Charlotte began drama classes at age 5. At 13, she is not afraid to speak publicly or join the student council; she listens and has confidence. “They go to these classes and come home feeling energized, like they accomplished something,” Williams says. And not just the outgoing kids — for the shy, theater opens them up. For children with anxiety, like so many children coming out of the pandemic, “the least judgmental place you can be is in a theater class.” You can keep your individuality, and unlike in sports, you’re not competing with anyone.",
      "On a warm day in April, Twila Cassadore piloted her pickup truck toward the mountains on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona to scout for wild edible plants. A wet winter and spring rains had transformed the desert into a plethora of color. Cassadore and J drove up a rough dirt road that used to be an old cattle trail, passing through various areas, moving from Sonoran desert to grasslands and pifion-juniper woodlands. In each area, Cassadore would stop to gather desert chia seeds, cacti flowers and thistles.\n\nAs a forager and celebrated food educator, Cassadore, 56, has spent the past 30 years documenting and teaching her fellow Western Apache people about the importance of wild foods in a region that’s considered one of the most biodiverse in the US — yet where diet and substance abuse are leading causes of death. Working closely with the tribe’s wellness center, the local high school and recovery groups, she often takes people out into the land to forage, cook and heal because she considers this activity to be redemptive.\n\nForaged food accounted for up to 50% of the Western Apache diet in pre-reservation times. In spring, it’s onions, potatoes, miner’s lettuce and thistles. In summer, it’s cacti fruit, berries and acorns — “the most prized food in our community,” Cassadore said. But after being forced on to reservations, the Apache were forbidden to gather their traditional foods and became dependent on rations and later, processed foods. By the time Cassadore was growing up on the 1.8m-acre reservation, she said that many people looked down on foraged food, or associated it with poverty.\n\nSo she was often teased by her elementary school classmates for bringing homemade beef jerky, acorns, pine nuts and dried mesquite pods foraged by her and her family, instead of the candy bars and sodas that everyone else had. Today the White River, San Carlos and Fort Apache reservations are considered food deserts with few grocery stores and limited access to fresh, healthy foods. “When you go to school with foraged food, you almost always got bullied,” she said. “That was traumatizing for me, and I was embarrassed to bring food from my own home. To me, eating foraged food, this was normal.” Cassadore later struggled with drug addiction and mental health issues for much of her life, but said that foraging provided her a way out. It allowed her to reconnect to her identity, culture and people, she said. She spent years learning about traditional foodways, gaining the trust of community elders, listening to their stories, and rediscovering the foods of her ancestors. This gave her purpose and “filled this void I had felt most of my life,” she said, and she is now 20 years sober.\n\nThrough her work, she now helps others struggling with addiction, depression and other mental health issues. “They come back with a connection of who they are, as an Apache person,” said Cassadore, recalling leading a traditional gloscho (desert woodrat) hunt with patients from a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. “It wakes up something inside of people. It calms them and makes them want to get better.” Naelyn Pike spent the summer after graduating high school working with Cassadore through the Traditional Western Apache Diet Project, a program to document and study traditional Ndee/Nnee (Western Apache) knowledge of the natural world and highlight the benefits of pre-reservation life and foods. Pike and other Apache youth spent days in the field with Cassadore, the project assistant, learning about Apache foods, recipes, and traditions. “It left a huge mark on my life,” said 23-year-old Pike, an Indigenous rights activist and executive assistant to the office of the chairman for the San Carlos Apache Tribe. “It teaches us the importance of our way of life as Apache people.” Like many of her peers, Pike has re-embraced foraging since her time with Cassadore, spending time each summer harvesting acorns, saguaro fruit and other wild foods. “I am very confident that when we go back to Apache foods, it doesn’t just benefit us physically, but mentally, emotionally and spiritually,” she said. “Taking part in this project has opened my eyes to understanding traditional values and how important our food is. We want to learn, preserve and grasp on to this way of life.” Tribal officials told The Guardian that people on the San Carlos Apache Reservation are facing interconnected epidemics of substance abuse, suicide and sexual violence — and the threat of ecological collapse. “For traditional people, these are all completely related,” said one tribal official who asked not to be named. “There are all kinds of historical reasons for people not living a balanced way of life. People like Twila are working really hard to bring the community back into this balance.” Cassadore is often scouting for the future. The banana yucca fruit won’t be ripe until October. However, the development of the flowers in spring will determine the plant’s fruit production. “A big patch like this is the best place to harvest,” she said of a large concentration of blooming banana yuccas whose white flowers resemble squash blossoms. She plans to return here in the fall to teach people from the community how to gather and prepare the fruit.\n\nAlong with foraging, Cassadore has interviewed more than 100 elders to help identify more than 200 wild edible plants and hundreds of traditional recipes, like acorn soup and agave pie with crust made from foraged seeds. She pulled her black Toyota truck off the side of Route 70 toward a patch of volcanic soil blanketed in small white flowers. She grabbed a screwdriver from the center console and started to dig wild vegetables from the rocky ground. “Onions,” she said. “Collect and be grateful.”",
      "Only take what you need.” She plans to eat them with dinner, along with elk and wild roasted potatoes foraged weeks earlier. “If you really want to start healing, work with the earth and ingredients that were given to us,” she said. (Adapted from The Guardian) Some members of the Western Apache community are returning to traditional food gathering methods. Some members of the Western Apache community have been able to solve many social and psychological problems through changes in diet. The recent change to traditional food gathering methods in the Western Apache community is the result of changes within American society as a whole. Children in the Western Apache community who bring foraged food to school are often envied by their classmates who have only processed foods at lunchtime. Although foraging is beneficial in many ways, it remains controversial within the Western Apache community.\n\nIn pre-reservation times, foraging was not the only food source in the Western Apache community. Native Americans suffer from a much higher rate of suicide than the general population. Some Native Americans are being healed through the practice of foraging. Foraging is promoting more individualism among some in the Western Apache community. Foraging will one day again replace mass food consumption on some reservations. Foraging is taking place solely through the efforts of some young people on reservations.",
      "The green revolution was one of the greatest feats of human ingenuity. By promoting higher yielding varieties of wheat and, especially, rice, plant-breeders in India, Mexico and the Philippines helped China emerge from a famine and India avoid one. From 1965 to 1995, Asia’s rice yields doubled and its poverty almost halved, even as its population soared.\n\nAsia’s vast rice market is a legacy of that triumph. The starchy grain is the main source of sustenance for over half the world’s population. Asians produce over 90% of rice and get more than a quarter of their calories from it. And demand for the crop is projected to soar, on the back of population growth in Asia and Africa, another big rice consumer. By one estimate, the world will need to produce almost a third more rice by 2050. Yet that looks increasingly hard — and in some ways undesirable.\n\nRice production is spluttering. Yields have increased by less than 1% a year over the past decade, much less than in the previous one. The greatest slowdowns were in South-East Asia, where Indonesia and the Philippines — together, home to 400m people — are already big importers. This has many explanations. Urbanisation and industrialisation have made labour and farmland scarcer. Excessive use of pesticides, fertiliser and irrigation have poisoned and depleted soils and groundwater. But the biggest reason may be global warming.\n\nRice is particularly susceptible to extreme conditions and is often grown in places where they are increasingly evident. Patchy monsoon rains and drought last year in India, the world’s biggest rice exporter, led to a reduced harvest and an export ban. Devastating floods in Pakistan, the fourth-biggest exporter, wiped out 15% of its rice harvest. Rising sea-levels are causing salt to seep into the Mekong Delta, Vietnam’s “rice bowl”.\n\nIt gets worse. Rice is not merely a casualty of climate change, but also a contributor to it. By starving soils of oxygen, paddy cultivation encourages methane-emitting bacteria. It is a bigger source of greenhouse gas than any foodstuff except beef. Its emissions footprint is similar to that of aviation. If you count the conversion of forestland for rice paddy — the fate of much of Madagascar’s rainforest — that footprint is even bigger.\n\nThis can insidious feedback loop and, in all, a far more complicated set of problems than the food insecurity that spurred the green revolution. Indeed, eating too much rice turns out to be bad for people as well as the climate. White rice is more fattening than bread or maize, and is not especially nutritious. In South Asia rice-heavy diets have been linked to high rates of diabetes and persistent malnutrition.\n\nPolicymakers need to increase rice yields, then, but more selectively than in the 1960s. In the places most suitable for rice cultivation, such as hot and sticky South-East Asia, faster adoption of new technologies, such as flood-resistant and more nutritious seeds, could provide a big productivity boost. In tandem with improved practices, such as direct seeding of paddy, they could also shorten the growing cycle and reduce the amount of water required, mitigating environmental harm. Farmers have been slow to adopt such improvements, partly because of overgenerous subsidies that shield them from the rice crisis. A better approach would make state support contingent on best practice. By encouraging crop insurance — a good idea in itself — governments could also help reassure farmers as they switch from old ways to new.\n\nGovernments need to nudge producers and consumers away from rice. India and Indonesia are promoting millet, which is more nutritious and uses a lot less water. Scrapping subsidies that favour rice over other crops would make such efforts more effective. India, for example, procures rice from farmers, often at above-market rates, then distributes it as food aid. It should make its interventions more crop-agnostic, by replacing subsidies and free rice with income support for farmers and cash transfers for the poor. That would encourage farmers to choose the best crop for their local conditions — much of India’s agricultural north-west would switch from rice to wheat overnight. Poor Indians would be free to choose a more balanced diet. Thereby, it would correct a market skewed towards environmental damage and poor health.\n\nBringing about such change in Asia and beyond will be far harder than promoting new wonder seeds. Farmers are almost everywhere a powerful constituency. Yet policymakers should get used to blending complicated economic and technological fixes in this way. Increasingly, it is what fighting climate change will demand. Sorting out the mounting crisis in the world’s most important foodstuff would be a good place to begin.",
      "Rice production should no longer be promoted because of its harmful effects on the environment and human health. Global warming has had a significant impact on rice production in Asia in recent decades. Policymakers need to implement new strategies to address the many challenges facing rice production. Despite the efforts of policymakers, producers and consumers have been slow to switch to crops other than rice. Governments need to implement policies that allow crop production to be adapted to local needs.\n\nRice is an essential food for people in Asia, so policymakers need to subsidize rice production. Providing income support to farmers and cash payments to the poor is a better policy option than subsidizing rice. As much as 75% of the total population of Asia depends on rice for their daily calorie intake. Climate-related hazards are the biggest contributor to the decline of rice production in Indonesia and the Philippines. Rice production is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from foodstuff. The Indian government promotes millet because it helped India avoid a famine in the past.",
      "So what did John Nash actually do? Viewers of the Oscar-winning film “A Beautiful Mind” might come away thinking he devised a new strategy to pick up women. Mr. Nash’s contribution was far more important than the somewhat contrived analysis about whether or not to approach the most beautiful woman in the bar. What he discovered was a way to predict the outcome of virtually any kind of strategic interaction. Today, the idea of “Nash equilibrium” is a central concept in game theory.\n\nModern game theory was developed by the great mathematician John von Neumann in the mid-1940s. His goal was to understand the general logic of strategic interaction, from military battles to price wars. Von Neumann, working with the economist Oskar Morgenstern, established a general way to represent games mathematically and offered a systematic treatment of games in which the players’ interests were aligned. Games of this sort — zero-sum games — are common in sporting events and parlor games. But most games of interest to economists are non-zero sum. When one person engages in voluntary trade with another, both are typically made better off. Although von Neumann and Morgenstern tried to analyze games of this sort, their analysis was not as satisfactory as that of the zero-sum games. Furthermore, the tools they used to analyze these two classes of games were completely different.\n\nMr. Nash came up with a much better way to look at non-zero-sum games. His method also had the advantage that it was equivalent to the von Neumann-Morgenstern analysis if the game happened to be zero sum. What Mr. Nash recognized was that in any sort of strategic interaction, the best choice for any single player depends critically on their beliefs about what the other players might do. Mr. Nash proposed that we look for outcomes in which each player is making an optimal choice, given the choices the other players are making. This is what is now known as a Nash equilibrium. At a Nash equilibrium, it is reasonable for each player to believe that all other players are playing optimally — since these beliefs are actually confirmed by the choices each player makes.\n\nIt’s a nice theory. But is it true? Does it describe actual behavior in actual games? Well, no. Game theory is limited: it analyzes how “fully rational” players should play if they all know they are playing against other fully rational players. That assumption of “full rationality” is the problem with game theory. In real life, most people — even economists — are not fully rational. Consider a simple example: several players are each asked to pick a number ranging from zero to 100. The player who comes closest to the number that is half the average of what everyone else says wins a prize. Before you read further, think about what number you would choose.\n\nNow consider the game theorist’s analysis. If everyone is equally rational, everyone should pick the same number. But there is only one number that is equal to half of itself — zero. This analysis is logical, but it isn’t a good description of how real people behave when they play this game: almost no one chooses zero. But it’s not as if the Nash equilibrium never works. Sometimes it works quite well. Two economists, Jacob Goeree and Charles Holt, recently published a clever article, “Ten Little Treasures of Game Theory and Ten Intuitive Contradictions,” that examines a number of games in which the Nash theory works well, and then shows that what should be an inconsequential change to the payoffs can result in a large change in behavior.\n\nIn their simplest example, two players, whom we will call Jacob and Charles, independently and simultaneously choose an amount from 180 cents to 300 cents. Both players are paid the lower of the two amounts, and some amount R (greater than 1) is transferred from the player who chooses the larger amount to the player who chooses the smaller one. If they both pick the same number, they both are paid that amount, but no transfer is made. So if Jacob chooses 200 and Charles chooses 220, the payoff to Jacob is 200 + R and the payoff to Charles is 200 - R. If Jacob thinks Charles will say 200, then Jacob will want to announce 199. But if Charles thinks Jacob will announce 199, then Charles should say 198. And so on. The only consistent pair of beliefs is when each thinks the other will say 180.\n\nWhen Mr. Goeree and Mr. Holt performed this experiment with R = 180, nearly 80 percent of the subjects picked 180, which is the Nash prediction. When they set R = 5, and reran the experiment (with different subjects), however, the outcomes were completely reversed, with nearly 80 percent choosing 300. Findings of this sort have stimulated the development of “behavioral game theory,” which tries to formulate a theory of how to understand games involving real people, rather than those “fully rational” people.\n\nConsider, for example, the “guess half the average” game described earlier. Oscar, a simple-minded player, might think that any number between zero and 100 is equally likely, so he would guess 50. Emmy, who is more sophisticated, might figure that if lots of people were like Oscar and say 50, then she should say 25. Tony, who is yet more sophisticated, figures that if lots of people think like Emmy, then he should say 12 or 13. And so on. An economist named Rosemarie Nagel ran a game like this a few years ago and found that the choices do tend to cluster around 50, 25 and 12. In fact, the winning choice turned out to be close to 13, a number chosen by about 30 percent of the players. In this game the best strategy wasn’t the Nash equilibrium, but it wasn’t so far away from it either."
