      "In 2019 there were 3,800 publicly disclosed data breaches, a significant increase over time. As security officers work to reduce the likelihood of breaches, there is an ongoing concern over the lack of user compliance with information security policies. Informational security policies depend on user compliance to protect computing resources. When users are lax with security measures and fail to follow security related directives, data breaches are more likely to occur. It is possible that users have capitulated and have decided that data breaches are inevitable and therefore their actions will not be effective in preventing data breaches in their organization.\n\nIn business, feelings of capitulation have been described as resulting from a perceived lack of control and autonomy. In psychology, capitulation is considered an end state occurring when individuals realize they cannot change their undesirable reality and do not have control of a detrimental situation. The inverse of this definition can be applied to organizational security; when users feel that they have control over technologies and that they possess greater autonomy, they are much more likely to constructively take part in individual security management and not give up. When users feel they lack control and autonomy and that security controls are centralized, they are inclined to ignore technologies aimed at securing the organization.\n\nOrganizational security has historically been controlled by policy making, placing the burden of security compliance on the end user; however, this has led some security researchers to suggest that the “user is not the enemy.” Authoritarian responses to security produce conflict between the organization’s security interests and end users' security behaviors. The manner in which users deal with these conflicts may include feelings of giving up, disengagement or capitulation. Often capitulation is viewed as a response to difficulty and equated to feelings of helplessness causing a person to fail to engage. Capitulation is defined here as the feeling of giving up or not acting because the behavior would not be productive or successful.\n\nSome research has supported the idea of negative security effects on employees and others report negative reactions based on punishment for information security policy violations which then lead to a reduction in the individual’s intent to comply. When organizations make employees responsible for computer security, they introduce stress into the work environment. These stressors may produce moral disengagement resulting in a lack of concern. Research showed how organizational security expectations can fail due to moral disengagement. Of interest, employees experiencing security overload, complexity and uncertainty may turn to moral disengagement. These diminished security behaviors may be due to the time, effort and frustration employees feel causing employee security requirements to fail. Moral disengagement may lead to an appraisal of commitment to the information security policy. Capitulation may be the result, affecting information security policy non-compliance in organizations. Whether users reduce their efforts, stop trying, take on new pursuits, look for other meaningful behaviors or disengage from complying with information security policies, the end result is a reduction in security.\n\nDistrust is defined as the feeling that someone or something cannot be relied upon. An individual experiencing distrust feels they cannot accept another’s statements or actions at face value. They are suspicious and feel that people are out to deceive them. Distrust has been characterized as having negative expectations, and distrust has been linked to fear, wariness and suspicion. Interestingly, distrust can be associated with a person, place or thing and it can be valuable in preventing exploitation.\n\nTrust and distrust are not the same, although they are often interchanged. As an illustration, trust is created with positive feelings, while distrust is associated with negative feelings; however, it is not the case that high trust levels will lead to lower distrust levels. Distrust can be a positive force because it can lead individuals to be more aware of threat actors.\n\nScrutiny of trust and distrust appears across many disciplines and research settings. Research on recommender agents established the difference between trust building and distrust building agents for information technology. The study results indicated that, within the context of technology applications, actions that build trust levels may not lower distrust levels. In fact, a disposition to distrust is the result of a lifetime of learned experiences. Factors that contribute to distrust are the reputation of the work organization and the individuals, perception of negative aspects of the work environment.\n\nOne interesting study suggested that individuals prone to distrust may avoid established security behaviors because they believe these actions can be anticipated by those seeking to deceive them. In consideration of human nature, it should be noted that, while individuals are predisposed to be trustful or distrustful, this is not an “either or” designation. Specifically, the same individual may be trustful or distrustful depending on the scenario and various factors surrounding the context of that scenario. How these feelings affect whether users comply with information systems security policies and the impact of capitulation is important.",
      "Information systems security administrators are responsible for keeping their information assets and systems safe from insider crimes' potential risks. Organizations have adopted two major strategies to prevent employees from committing insider attacks: stimulating employees' conscience and adopting techniques to reduce the opportunity of committing crimes. IS security administrators have curbed their employees' motivation for committing insider crimes.\n\nIS security administrators need to eliminate the environmental opportunities that can be considered a crack for insiders' malicious attempts. According to the rational choice theory, malicious insiders are willing to commit malfeasances only when the expected rewards of malicious behaviors outweigh the anticipated risks or costs. Thus, IS security administrators need to focus on increasing costs and decreasing the anticipated benefits of malicious behaviors. This security policy is less likely to induce malicious insiders to put their plan into action, such as electronic monitoring and surveillance, access control, and installing physical barriers, not solely relying on dealing with the internal motivations of insiders.",
      "However, this approach at the organizational level is inherently coupled with the possibility of infringing on each employee's space. As there will be more restrictions imposed on each individual's actions, it may undermine the trust-based bilateral relationship between employees and employers. Moreover, employees having no choice other than consenting to the organizational policy might be problematic because of a massive bargaining power gap between employees and employers in this bilateral relationship. Despite the seemingly nonexistent problems in procedures, employees have been forced to contract out their privacy rights even with their full awareness of the policy's potential to infringe on their personal spaces. Such a tremendous bargaining power gap may lead employees to have negative reactions, such as computer abuse. These reactions are potential adverse effects on organizational efforts that aim to minimize the opportunity of committing a crime from the perspective of malicious insiders.\n\nPrior research has mainly focused on trust and largely ignored distrust, partly because of the assumption that trust building and distrust building are two ends of one continuum; thus, an IT (information technology) design that increases trust building in the IT will decrease distrust building at the same time. However, this assumption may not be true if trust-building and distrust-building processes in the context of IT usage are actually two separate and different processes. For example, a customer can use a web-based product recommendation agent (RA) to get personalized advice on which products to buy, based on his or her personal needs. Online customers have to trust an RA before complying with its advice. In our protocol analysis study, an RA explained a product feature (computer screen) in detail using technical language. We observed that some users trusted this RA because its explanation was detailed and professional. But this RA’s explanation feature does not necessarily automatically reduce distrust at the same time. Other users may not fully understand the technical explanation provided and their confusion about the RA’s explanation may lead them to distrust the RA’s competence and integrity. In another example, a finance website takes a while to download its contents. The downloading time may lead one customer to distrust the technical competence of the website because she does not know why she needs to wait so long. The same downloading time may lead to trust in the website if another customer believes the wait is due to many graphs and figures with valuable up-to-the-minute stock market information. Therefore, it is important to understand, through the collection of empirical evidence, the actual processes of trust building and distrust building, i.e., how users interpret an IT’s features to form their trusting/distrusting beliefs.",
      "Different individuals but not the same individual may be trusting or distrusting depending on the context in which a decision is made. Recommender agents build trust among individuals with varied backgrounds regardless of the context in which a decision is made. Recommender agents lessen distrust for individuals with varied backgrounds in all contexts in which a decision is made.\n\nUsers who lack understanding and autonomy when interacting with technology may experience which of the following? Which of the following best describes the relationships between Texts I, II, and III? Text I introduces two principles of organizational security and Texts II and III describe them in more detail. Texts I and II explain some principles in organizational security while Text III exemplifies one of the principles. Texts I, II, and III each define different principles of organizational security and Text III addresses a specific case. Text I explains the principles of organizational security, Text II explains an alternative view, and Text III links the views.\n\nFrom the point of view of strict logic, a rigorous course on analysis should precede a course on calculus. Strict logic is, however, overruled by both history and practicality. Historically, calculus, with its origins in the 17th century, came first, and made rapid progress on the basis of informal intuition. Not until well through the 19th century was the theory constructed on sound logical foundations. As for practicality, every university teacher knows that students are not ready for even a semi-rigorous course on analysis until they have acquired the intuitions and skills that come from a traditional calculus course. Analysis, I have always thought, is the pons asinorum (the bridge of asses, that is, a critical test of ability that separates the clever from the foolish) of modern mathematics. This shows, I suppose, how much progress we have made in two thousand years, for it is a great deal more sophisticated than the Theorem of Pythagoras, which once received that title. All who have taught the subject know how patient one has to be, for the ideas take root gradually, even in students of good ability. This is not too surprising, since it took more than two centuries for calculus to evolve into what we now call analysis, and even a gifted student, guided by an expert teacher, cannot be expected to grasp all of the issues immediately. I have not set out to do anything very original, since in a field as well-established as analysis, originality too easily becomes eccentricity. Although it is important to demonstrate the limitations of a visual, intuitive approach by means of some “strange” examples of functions, too much emphasis on “pathology” gives altogether the wrong impression of what analysis is. I hope I have avoided that error.",
      "Suppose you've started an online furniture store that specializes in various types of sofas. Some are attractive to customers because of their comfort and others because of price. Is there anything you can think to do that would incline visitors to your website to focus on the feature of comfort and, consequently, to prefer to make a sofa purchase that prioritized it over cost? You’ve no need to labor long for an answer, because two marketing professors, Naomi Mandel and Eric Johnson, have provided insight in a set of studies using just such an online furniture site. When Mandel began the research project in the late 1990s, the impact of virtual stores such as Amazon and eBay was only beginning to emerge. But how to optimize success within this form of exchange had not been addressed systematically.\n\nIn an article largely overlooked since it was published in 2002, they described how they were able to draw website visitors’ attention to the goal of comfort merely by placing fluffy clouds on the background wallpaper of the site’s landing page. This maneuver led those visitors to assign elevated levels of importance to comfort when asked what they were looking for in a sofa.\n\nFor example, in an intervention using young non-gamer adults, we found that 2 weeks of playing Super Mario 3D World improved hippocampal-based memory performance relative to both active and no-contact control groups, with the amount of exploration in the game correlating with the amount of improvement.\n\nIn this study, 2 weeks of spatial exploration of the virtual world and building complex structures with resources gathered in the world resulted in a robust improvement in memory ability.\n\nPrior research in our lab and others has demonstrated positive effects of large, immersive 3D video game playing on hippocampal-based memory ability.\n\nIn yet another study, we used Minecraft to more directly manipulate the amount and type of enrichment.\n\nWe found a similar effect in older adults (60-80 years) with 4 weeks of playing improving memory ability such that it matched performance of participants 15-20 years younger.\n\nOne clear aspect of many modern video games is that they provide a novel, rich world to explore. Decades of neuroscience research dating back to pioneering efforts by Donald Hebb have shown that simply placing laboratory animals in enriched environments improves cognitive performance within a wide range of underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nThus, there is substantial neurobiological evidence to support the idea that environmental enrichment, even from video games, might have a positive effect on the hippocampus and the memory abilities it supports.\n\nVideo games and Esports do not always enjoy a positive view in our society, despite the popularity of video games and the rising impact of Esports. Yet, at their core, modern video games often provide incredibly rich cognitive experiences, opportunities for problem solving, for competition, for teamwork, and for social interaction. As a result, gaming and Esports have the potential to provide considerable positive effects to the brain.\n\nThis “environmental enrichment” can not only ameliorate age-related effects on memory and structures in the brain like the hippocampus, known to support memory, but it has been shown to reduce the presence of both the amyloid-beta plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles in mouse models of Alzheimer’s Disease, rescue deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, improve hippocampal-based memory, and up-regulate neurotrophic factors important to environmental enrichment.",

      "Ignatius Loyola, a nobleman, soldier, and later a priest, at the beginning of his only book, Spiritual Exercises, proposed a ground rule, termed the presupponendum. It reads: “Every good Christian ought to be more eager to put a good interpretation on a neighbour’s statement than to condemn it. Further, if one cannot interpret it favourably, one should ask how the other means it. If that meaning is wrong, one should correct the person with charity; and if this is not enough, one should search out every appropriate means through which, by understanding the statement in a good way, it may be saved.” Obviously, Ignatius wrote it for Christians, and only in a specific context. However, we will try to show that this may serve as an inspiration for creating a procedure which preserves all the insights leading to the principle of charity while allowing us to learn from encounters with different epistemic perspectives and substantially improving one’s own worldview.\n\nWithin Ignatius’ rule we may distinguish four steps, which in fact amount to a procedure of “presupposing,” which will be very useful for modelling a dialectical principle of charity.\n\nConsider the following definitions of two types of arguments.\n\nStraw man argument — An argument that is formulated by a debater as a very weak form of their opponent’s argument, often done by misrepresenting their opponent’s argument so that it can be easily knocked down.\n\nSteel man argument — A reformulation of an opponent’s argument into the strongest argument possible based on what the opponent has said; often used to make the argument more intellectually challenging.",
      "memory. Unfortunately, working memory is highly limited. We can hold only three or four new items in working memory at any one time. This places a huge limit on our ability to solve problems. You can see this by increasing the length of a range of multiplication problems. If you are asked to solve the problem mentally, then it is possible for you to succeed, because doing so does not require you to hold new information in your working memory at once. But there is still a chance you will make errors, because you do have to use your working memory to remember a few things. You can solve this problem several ways; the following is probably the most common: Put 2 down, carry 4.\n\nAdd 4 to 28=32.\n\nRemember you had put 2 down.\n\nThus, the final answer is.\n\nWhatever method you use to calculate this, you have to hold one piece of information in your working memory while you work out the next piece. Then you have to recall the first piece of information because you need to do something that involves using it and the second piece together. It is typical when solving problems like this to forget the result of the first calculation by the time you have got to the end of the last calculation. Multiplying a three-digit number by a one-digit number would test working memory even further.\n\nAnd if you are asked to solve the problem mentally, you almost certainly will not succeed. It is not that you do not know how to solve the problem; it is that solving it involves you holding far too many new pieces of information in your working memory at once.",
      "Because of the huge commitment involved, nobody wanted to oversee the organization’s annual fundraising drive. The experimental findings suggested that a long-accepted theory was in doubt and needed re-examination. The executive was implicated in the scheme to avoid paying taxes by offshoring company income. We were devastated to learn that our pet had late stage cancer and would probably not live more than a few more weeks. Due to the stormy weather, the ferry reached the station over two hours late. The setting for the opening scene of the film is a university graduation ceremony in the mid-20th century. After you open your browser, you'll need to change certain settings in order to make it run more securely. While many in the public cast strong suspicions on them, the board of trustees showed integrity in their honest dealings with the matter.
