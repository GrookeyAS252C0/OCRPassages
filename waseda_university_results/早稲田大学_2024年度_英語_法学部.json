      "The Russian Tsar Peter the Great presided over an actual fashion police. His inspectors stalked the streets of St. Petersburg, shaving beards and snipping inches off coats.\n\nIf you were a bearded man in St. Petersburg around the year 1714, a token like the one pictured here would be your only defense against the overweening power of the state. It served as proof that the bearer had paid his yearly beard tax — a few kopecks for peasants, a hundred rubles or more for nobles or military officials.\n\nThe beard tax was just one part of a larger project: Peter the Great’s aesthetic reinvention of Russian culture. The Tsar ordered his subjects to replace their familiar long Russian overcoats with French or Hungarian jackets. Mannequins set outside the Moscow city gates illustrated the new fashions for all to see. Tailors who continued to sell Russian styles ran the risk of steep fines, and anyone walking the streets in an old-fashioned robe was liable to have it cut short by the Tsar's inspectors.\n\nThe project had its roots in Tsar Peter’s days travelling around Europe. In 1697, when he set out on a grand tour, Peter chose to travel in disguise, adopting the name “Sergeant Pyotr Mikhaylov.” Excited rumors of his visit spread from town to town, heralding him as a giant: seven feet tall, brilliant, and only half-civilized. The trip would consume the next two years. For a time, he worked at a Dutch shipyard to learn ship-building techniques. He visited heads of state, collections of natural curiosities, and anatomical theaters, and threw legendarily wild parties. One particularly raucous event left every one of his host’s chairs smashed into pieces, his paintings shredded into ribbons, and chunks of pavement torn out of the ground.\n\nUpon returning from his travels, Peter launched immediately into the process of “Europeanizing” his homeland. The first of the Tsar’s new enthusiasm were the beards of his court nobles, shaved at his welcome-home party. As biographer Robert K. Massie writes, “After passing among his [friends and embracing them...he began shaving off their beards” with his own hands. He doubled down at his New Year’s banquet, at which his razor-wielding court jester worked the crowd, slapping the side of the head of anyone who seemed reluctant to shave.\n\nAccording to Captain John Perry, an English visitor to Russia, the Russians submitted only upon “the terror of having [their beards] ...pulled out by the roots, or sometimes taken so rough off, that some of the skin went with them.” He goes on to tell the story of a Russian carpenter who was obliged by the Tsar’s decree to lose his beard: I jested a little with him on this occasion, telling him that he had become a young man, and asked him what he had done with his beard. Upon which he put his hand in his bosom and pulled it out, and showed it to me; also telling me, that upon returning home, he would carefully keep it to have it put in his coffin and buried along with him, that he might be able to give an account of it to Saint Nicholas in the afterlife: and that all his fellow workmen who had been shaved that day had taken the same care.\n\nIn this, the carpenter was guided by the teachings of the Russian Orthodox Church, which considered uncut facial hair a reflection of piety. Man was created in the image of God; that included the beard. To shave it was a grave sin.\n\nTo the pious, the beard tax was a shocking scandal. Rumors circulated that Peter was not the real Tsar but a replacement installed by Russia’s enemies. Anonymous letters accusing the Tsar of blasphemy were scattered on the city streets. Nevertheless, the shavings continued. Finally, in 1705, a Russian military division initiated an open revolt in the town of Astrakhan. A letter from the rebels proclaimed that they were for Christianity and against shaving and foreign dress. The revolt was crushed, and hundreds of rebels lost their lives.\n\nThe beard tax was just one way that the Tsar sparred with the Church. With typical flair, Peter organized his drinking companions into a club known as the “All-Jesling and All-Drunken Religious Assembly of Fools and Jesters.” The members played at being cardinals and bishops and performed mock marriages and religious ceremonies. They engaged in constant merriment, compulsory drunkenness, and endless feasts and masquerades. There was no escape from the All-Drunken Assembly; appointments were for life. In this way, blasphemy served as a test of loyalty for the Tsar's closest companions. The implicit choice was clear.\n\nAs the historian V. M. Zhivov writes in “Cultural Reforms in Peter the Great's System of Transformations,” by challenging the Church's power, the Tsar sought to frame himself as a semi-divine figure, outside of the bounds of normal society:\n\nThe Tsar demonstrated that he commanded divine power, and society had the choice of either accepting this inhuman superiority or rejecting it as a satanic enterprise. In any case this posed for society. The Tsar rose above reality and, wielding the power of life and death, transformed that reality according to his desire, turning age-old customs into blasphemous entertainments.",
      "playful inventions into state institutions. Like the beard tax itself, the conflict seems absurd: a few drunken nobles playing pretend priests. But the struggle — one over the very nature of royal power — was deadly serious.\n\nWe stood up for the Christian faith and against shaving and German dress and tobacco and because we and our wives and children were not admitted into God’s church in old Russian dress. And those who went to church, of both male and female sexes, had their garments chopped up and were pushed out of God’s churches and sent packing. “Show and tell” was a method that Peter frequently employed to ensure that the public would not excuse themselves by pleading ignorance of his policies.",
      "In 1708 an informer reported that, when the Tsar was in Moscow, everyone wore German dress but in his absence the wives of some of the Tsar’s leading officials wore old-fashioned gowns to church, even though they put skirts over them, cursing the sovereign’s decree. One can infer that the skirts worn by the wives were meant as protest.\n\nHere “liable” means held legally responsible.\n\nHere “doubled down” means committed even further.\n\nHere “piety” means devotion.\n\nHere “compulsory” means mandatory.",
      "In contrast to their generally similar levels of performance on standardized tests, American boys and girls perform very differently when measured by grades in their courses in school. Because performance in courses is less standardized, there is less consensus on gender differences in this measure of academic performance. Nonetheless, evidence indicates that girls have outperformed boys academically since the turn of the twentieth century. In the middle of the nineteenth century, girls enrolled in coeducational schools at roughly the same rate as boys, and for the most part, girls in those schools took the same classes with the same teachers as their male counterparts. Even then, girls earned higher grades than boys and were promoted to the next year level more readily. Writing in 1910, J. E. Armstrong reported that “the first three primary year levels of the schools of the whole United States show that a larger number of boys than girls have to repeat their year levels; the census shows that the sexes are born in very nearly equal numbers and yet the boys are four percent more numerous in the first grade.” It is also striking that as early as 1870, when rates of high school completion were extremely low (only two percent of seventeen-year-olds completed high school at the time), more girls than boys completed high school.\n\nRegardless of their better performance in elementary school and higher rates of high school completion, young women were barred from attending college for much of the nineteenth century. They were first allowed to enroll in college in 1837, when Oberlin College began admitting women, arguably to provide ministers of religion with intelligent, cultivated, and thoroughly schooled wives. When the Civil War led to a shortage of male students, more colleges became willing to enroll tuition-paying female students. By 1900, more than twice as many women were enrolled in coeducational institutions as were enrolled in women’s colleges. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the rapid rise in the number of women enrolling in coeducational institutions precipitated a new fear that women would take over colleges.\n\nFast-forward to the current era, and the female advantage in academic performance at all levels of education is indisputable. As early as kindergarten, girls demonstrate more advanced reading skills than boys, and boys continue to have problems with reading in elementary school. From kindergarten through high school and into college, girls get better grades than boys in all major subjects, including math and science. This leads us to ask if school-based policies can help improve the educational performance of boys. Boys face particular challenges stemming from the dual nature of masculine identity during adolescence. In schools with cultures that treat academic success as compatible with a respectable status within the adolescent culture, boys are more likely to perform on a par with girls. In other words, we expect the male shortfall to be relatively small in high-quality schools.\n\nThree promising arenas of school policy intervention have the potential to improve student outcomes: teachers, student culture, and instructional and evaluation techniques. Firstly, a growing literature suggests that teacher quality affects academic performance, and some recent reports suggest that good teachers have long-lasting effects on their students. Scholars also increasingly recognize that, along with cognitive skills, social and behavioral skills affect academic achievement and later success in the labor market, and that teachers differ in their ability to promote these skills. Beyond teachers, other support staff such as guidance counselors may play an important role in students’ educational outcomes. The second promising arena of policy change, student culture and peer effects, has been a focus since the early 1960s. Finally, instructional effects are the most difficult of the three school policy interventions to study, partly because instructional curricula are not readily quantifiable. Considerable research suggests that small class sizes are better than large ones, that putting students into college preparation tracks is generally detrimental to poorly performing students, and that tough academic standards do not boost academic achievement for poorly performing students. These policy areas clearly overlap with each other; for example, teachers can contribute to student climate, better instructional techniques may improve teacher quality, and academically oriented student cultures may improve both the effectiveness of some teachers and the impact of some instructional techniques.\n\nAttachment to school is an equally powerful motivator for educational performance. Despite common perceptions, students do not generally disparage academic achievement, so long as it is accompanied by other desirable behaviors like being popular, dressing stylishly, being athletic, and otherwise participating in extracurricular activities. John Bishop and his colleagues report that 81 percent of middle and high school students who were surveyed disagreed with the statement that “it’s not cool to frequently volunteer answers or comments in class,” 85 percent disagreed with the statement that “it’s not cool to study real hard for tests and quizzes,” and 73 percent disagreed with the statement that “it’s not cool to be enthusiastic about what you are learning in school.” Apparently students begin to cross the “not cool” line when they exhibit overt competitiveness about grades, but students generally appreciate that high levels of educational achievement are valuable in today’s world.\n\nAt the same time, it is also clear from the data that girls express stronger allegiance to educational values than boys. Eighth-grade students were asked how important grades were to them and how",
      "important they perceived grades to be to their parents. Almost 99 percent of the students reported that good grades are “very important” to their parents, with essentially no variations in these proportions by gender, parental education, or parents’ educational expectations for their child. Girls expressed a valuation that was closer to what they attributed to their parents than was the case for boys, showing that boys place greater distance between their values and the values they attribute to their parents than do girls.\n\nNow that a female advantage in educational achievement has emerged, it is natural to ask whether and how schools affect gender inequality. We need to consider whether school policies that help one gender also help the other, or whether the interests of boys and girls are incompatible, such that policies designed to help boys compete with those designed to help girls.",
      "E training high quality teachers who can promote social and behavioral skills. According to the study by John Bishop and his colleagues on middle and high school students, about half think that being overtly competitive is acceptable. Around three-quarters think it is okay to enjoy what they are studying. Most see the value of educational achievement. Over four-fifths think it is not cool to volunteer answers in class. The vast majority believe it is acceptable to study hard for tests.\n\nThe police officer warned the mayor, “You do not want to give us reason to arrest you. You will be charged with interfering with an officer of the law if you continue to obstruct this investigation. Your son has been caught selling information of a sensitive nature that he stole from his workplace then trying to run away. We are not at liberty to share any details beyond this, as it could compromise the case. Now, please stand aside.” Baby seals need solid ice to survive, but a warming world and shortage of stable ice in recent years have led to a raise in their deaths. Because of their different chemistry, some types of plastic are very easy to recycle, whereas until something changes, landfill is the only destination for other. The scientists found that human volunteers could correctly guess the meaning of each gesture made by apes over 50% of the time. When a large star dies, it explodes into a brilliant burst of light that temporarily illuminates the night skies.",
      "The lawsuit began like so many others: a man named Roberto Mata sued the airline Avianca, saying he was injured when a metal serving cart struck his knee during a flight to New York City.\n\nAvianca asked a Manhattan federal judge to dismiss the case, Mr. Mata’s lawyers strongly objected, submitting a ten-page brief that cited multiple relevant court decisions. There was Martinez v. Delta Air Lines, Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines, and Varghese v. China Southern Airlines, its detailed discussion of complex federal law.\n\nThere was one hitch: no one — not the airline’s lawyers, not even the judge himself — could find the decisions or the quotations cited and summarized in the brief.\n\nThat was because ChatGPT had invented everything.\n\nThe lawyer who created the brief, Steven A. Schwartz, threw himself at the court, confessing that he had used the AI program to do his legal research — “a source that has revealed itself to be unreliable.”"
