      "Pre-school children learn the meanings of more than ten new words each day, and they understand the meanings of those words well enough to use them in fluent communication. They use these words to express a welter of opinions on what they think is good or bad, right or wrong, and all too readily wail “It’s not fair!”. But how can a young child — and the rest of us — really know what these words mean? After all, the most brilliant thinkers across millennia have found that these everyday notions — goodness, the difference between right and wrong, the nature of fairness — are sunk in conceptual quicksand. How can young children master concepts that philosophers struggle to analyse?\n\nThe answer is that philosophers wrestle with the challenge of providing a general theory of “deep” concepts to explain the fundamental meaning of such notions as good, fair, cause, mind and so on. But children and adults only have to get meaning sufficiently clear to deal with the specific communicative challenge of the moment. To communicate successfully, a cry of “It’s not fair!” must express the outrage a child feels when given a smaller slice of cake or made to wait in a queue. But this communication does not require the child (or the unfortunate parent) to have a general theory of fairness in mind. Indeed, the “meaning” that allows us to get by successfully is often shallow.\n\nConsider, for example, how children use alive and dead. Susan Carey, a developmental psychologist at Harvard, had the following instructive and rather delightful interchanges with her daughter Eliza on the subject. When someone is shot on a TV programme, Eliza (three years and six months) explains: “He’s dead — I can tell because he’s not moving.” This seems similar to how we adults define dead. But then, Carey asks about Eliza’s toy bear: E: ... She’ll always be alive.\n\nS: Is she alive? E: No — she’s dead. HOW CAN THAT BE? S: Is she alive or dead? E: Dead.\n\nS: Did she used to be alive? E: No, she’s middle-sized in between alive and dead. She moves sometimes.\n\nAnd then comes the astonishing question: E: How do dead people go to the bathroom? S: What? E: Maybe they have bathrooms under the ground.\n\nS: Dead people don’t have to go to the bathroom. They don’t do anything; they just lie there. They don’t eat or drink, so they don’t have to go to the bathroom. E: But they ate or drank before they died — they have to go to the bathroom from just before they died.\n\nEliza doesn’t, surely, have a clear and distinct concept of alive and dead. Her toy bear is not alive; but then again, her bear moves sometimes, so it must be alive, or perhaps it’s in some intermediate state. And dead people are, it seems, still carrying on with normal bodily functions. On a separate occasion (aged three years and eight months) she exclaims: “Isn’t it funny — statues aren’t alive, but you can still see them?” Her grandfather is not alive, and you can’t see him, she notes.\n\nEliza is clearly a very observant reasoner. And she is also an astute player of verbal charades. People throw around the words alive and dead, but what are they getting at? Well, dead things don’t seem to move; and you can’t go to see dead people. But the idea that alive and dead only apply to biological organisms — which seems so central from an adult perspective — seems to be absent or perhaps only for Eliza. What is really astonishing is that, in most of our interactions with pre-school children, we mostly don’t have the faintest inkling that their understanding of words is so different from ours. Just as with the interpretation of actions and gestures in charades, children learn to understand words well enough to make sense of the current, specific context in which they hear a word used. The motionless person who has been shot is called dead. Relatives and pets — who are no longer seen — are also described as dead. Young children can create their own charades for the adults around them, using those same words remarkably well — in fact, well enough that huge conceptual contradictions (such as toy bears being both alive and dead) almost never show up in daily conversation.\n\nBut the same issues arise when adults communicate. What is it, precisely, to be alive? Typical biology textbooks can do no better than a descriptive list: living things grow, reproduce, eat and excrete, regulate their internal chemistry and temperature, are composed of one or more cells, pass on their traits through their genes and so on. But this leaves tricky cases such as viruses (not composed of cells, not able to reproduce independently), viroids (circular RNA strands that replicate autonomously inside a host plant), prions (infectious proteins), and even the androids of the future (could a machine be conscious without being alive?). The definition of life, like the definitions of good, justice, right and wrong, has been the subject of endless and unresolved debates for millennia. And our conception of life is full of contradictions. Wouldn’t an afterlife be a type of life? And if so, should the biological criteria",
      "be mostly thrown out? The people in an imagined afterlife aren’t actually dead, are they? And what about cryogenic freezing — is suspended animation a form of life, or death, or does it fall somewhere in between? These types of questions are mostly irrelevant in the vast majority of linguistic charades we play in everyday communication — the tricky cases just don’t arise much in ordinary conversation. What matters is that we can get along well enough when dealing with the situations that actually occur in daily life. We no more need a mental definition of life to talk about living relatives or dead pets than we need a biological definition of gorillas to mime King Kong. Both pre-school children and adults use words as players use gestures in charades — in creative, contradictory ways that are good enough to get through the language games of the moment. In learning a language, we are learning to play creative conversational games with words. And playing those conversational games requires paying attention to likely communicative objectives, the contents of the environment, and past linguistic usage — the hidden parts of the communication iceberg are just as important as the words themselves.",
      "Most people need not be concerned by philosophical questions of meaning. We need to memorize the definitions of words that other people use. People have numerous reasons to negotiate the meanings of life and death. Children’s games are an important part of learning about life and death.\n\nWhich statement best summarizes this article? People are able to communicate clearly using words because we already share a common understanding. We are constantly negotiating the meaning of different concepts even in daily interactions. Young children play charades because they are not good at using language the same way as adults. People in different countries use different nonverbal strategies to communicate when they lack the vocabulary to speak.",
      "Modern historians count 1967 as an especially busy year: the six-day war, the summer of love, Sgt Pepper, the first recorded deaths of American astronauts, the founding of the suburban utopia of Milton Keynes. And also, half-forgotten in the crush, perhaps the most consequential event of all: the invention of the first device ever that permitted us to henceforward stop using a part of our brains.\n\nA young Dallas engineer named Jerry Merryman and his team gave us, courtesy of his employers, Texas Instruments, the Cal-Tech electronic calculator. For $400 you could own a shirt-pocket-sized plastic box with buttons and symbols that, if pressed, would answer in an instant, and with impeccable accuracy, any simple arithmetical question you might ask it. And most important, it performed its work invisibly. The abacus and the slide rule might have been mental labour-saving devices, but they still required you to make some use of your grey matter; the Cal-Tech freed you up entirely, removing all mathematical tedium from your daily life.\n\nIt was semiconductors and algorithms that helped make Merryman’s magic, and for the 60 years since, and in the hands of other similarly blessed engineers, they have continued to do so, relentlessly.\n\nTheir gifts have been all we might ever have wished for. Our brains can now relax. Whatever cerebral nooks and crannies we employed, for instance, to read paper maps, or to use sextants and compasses and chronometers to find out where we were, have now been put into cold storage: GPS has given us all the direction we might ever need. Not sure how to spell a word or how best to compose a sentence? From the 1980s onward there has been no urgent further need for an OED or a copy of Fowler’s Modern English Usage: Commodore’s WordCheck and its successors have such matters taken care of.\n\nAnd after the presentation in April 1998 at a conference in Brisbane by two (now very rich) young Americans named Page and Brin, of their paper The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine, we had Google, which, for the past quarter-century, has been able to answer all our questions about just about anything in microseconds. OpenAI is currently inventing even more advanced things that promise to blow out of the water whatever still remains of the requirement to do mental work.\n\nThis has in recent months led to widespread hand-wringing. Our minds, it is said, will inevitably fall out of use, atrophying, or distending, whichever is worse.\n\nThe nightmare model — for our bodies — is a movie like Wall-E, that dystopian vision from 2008 in which humans, having abandoned their polluted and garbage-choked world, live out their lives in cocoons suspended in suborbital space. Here they have evolved into flaccid slobs, marooned in recliners, fed on high-calorie mush from squeeze-packs while gazing glassily at telescreens.\n\nSo now there comes a similarly dire vision for our minds. With machines doing all our daily mental tasks for us, our brains will become literally thoughtless, our minds a haven for endless daydreaming. We will become spiritually moribund. As inherent knowledge vanishes, no longer much needed since it is now always on tap at the slightest brush of a touch-glass surface, the concept of human wisdom, which is after all a mix of knowledge and experience, will evaporate. Society will slowly flounder and decay, body, mind and soul.\n\nThis is one vision of our future doom. But I am not a doomsayer — not so far as our minds are concerned, at least. I challenge the notion that all is now going to intellectual decline. Rather I see ample reason for optimism. And I draw this from the sextet of Ancient Greeks who laid the foundations for and defined the very idea of knowledge: Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus and Euclid.\n\nThese figures, rightly revered and sanctified by time, had minds essentially little different from the finest of our own today — except in one important respect: there was, in the centuries in which these men lived, so much less for them to know.\n\nKarl Popper’s droll and much-quoted remark that “knowledge is finite but ignorance is infinite” is objectively true, of course — and yet the amount of knowledge in our contemporary mental universe is immeasurably more vast than that in which the intellectual elite of classical times existed. These six and their like travelled little (Aristotle excepted), existing in a world necessarily circumscribed by so little known geography, by very much less history, by the existence of so little written prior description. Their minds, though steeped in the totality of contemporary knowledge, were thus almost tabulae rasae — nearly empty, ready to think, primed for purpose.\n\nWhich is why our modern minds, once they have been purged of all that today’s algorithms might now deem unnecessary information, will be as ready as theirs were to think, to inquire, to wonder, to contemplate, to imagine, to create.\n\nSo I see today’s algorithmic revolution as a necessary cleansing, a movement by which we rid ourselves of all the accumulated bricolage of modern intellectual life, returning us to a more reasonable sound-to-noise ratio, gifting us with a renewed innocence, filled with potential.\n\nFanciful though it may sound, this new-made post-AI society could even see the emergence of a new Euclid, a new Plato, a new Herodotus. Such figures may now be waiting in the wings, ready to rise.",

      "For decades, researchers, hospice caregivers and stunned family members have watched with awe as people with Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia suddenly regain their memories and personalities just before death. To their family members it might seem like a second lease on life, but for many experienced medical workers, it can be a sign the end is near. Christopher Kerr, chief executive officer and chief medical officer at the Center for Hospice and Palliative Care in Buffalo, N.Y., has studied the lucid visions of several hundred terminally ill people. He says these events usually occur in the last few days of life. Such terminal lucidity is defined as the unexpected return of cognitive faculties such as speech and connectedness with other people, according to George Mason University’s Andrew Peterson, a researcher of bioethics and consciousness who co-authored a study of the phenomenon commissioned by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThis connectedness goes beyond the return of lost communication ability and situational awareness. One thing that seems to be quite significant for family members who observe lucidity is something we call the ‘old self emerging,’ Peterson says. There seems to be clear evidence that they're aware not merely of their surroundings but additionally understanding what their relationships to other people are — be it the use of a nickname or a reference to a longstanding inside joke.\n\nAs surprising as these events might seem, they are quite common. Our study wasn’t a prevalence study, says Jason Karlawish, a gerontologist at the Penn Memory Center and senior principal investigator of the NIH study. Nevertheless, he adds, what we found is lucidity was more common than it was the exception in dementia patients, which would suggest that the idea of it being terminal is not entirely correct. Instead he suggests that episodes of lucidity should be seen as part of the overall experience rather than as isolated events. We've actually found that a variety of these episodes occurred months, even years, before the person died, Karlawish notes. Even so, many experts including Kerr and Parnia agree that most of these episodes are associated with the approach of death. It’s almost like they’re preparing themselves to die, Parnia says.\n\nThe potential implications of these widespread, temporary cognitive resurgences are profound. It suggests there may be neural networks that are remaining, and/or pathways and neural function, that could help potentially restore cognitive abilities to individuals we otherwise think are permanently impaired, Peterson says. Despite this uncertainty, other research into brain activity near or at the time of death could provide scientists and clinicians greater insight into some of the processes occurring in the diseased and dying brain.\n\nIn a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in May, researchers at the University of Michigan observed a surge of organized brain activity in two out of four comatose people who were undergoing cardiac arrest after being removed from life support. This work built on more than a decade of animal research, including a 2013 PNAS study that revealed a similar surge in synchronized brain activity in rats exposed to a cardiac toxin and a 2015 study in which rats were killed by asphyxiation. In all of these investigations, the researchers found that gamma-wave activity surged within the first few minutes of cardiac arrest and then ceased. Gamma waves are a frequency of brain wave typically associated with wakefulness, alertness and memory recall.\n\nJimo Borjigin, a neurologist and an associate professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the University of Michigan, was involved in all three studies. The surge of gamma waves in dying subjects was particularly intense in a brain region Borjigin refers to as the “posterior cortical hot zone,” located near the back of the skull. Some other researchers believe this region may also be essential to conscious experience. The parts of the brain in this area are related to visual, auditory and motion perception — a phenomenon Borjigin believes is involved in the out-of-body experiences reported by people who come close to death and recover. She adds that gamma-wave activation patterns akin to those observed in the comatose people are associated with activities that include the recognition of a familiar image — such as a human face — in healthy people.\n\nIn both the human and animal studies, the subjects’ brain showed a spike in activity after the sudden reduction of oxygen supply, Borjigin says. It starts to activate this homeostatic mechanism to get oxygen back, either by breathing harder or making your heart beat faster, she adds. Borjigin hypothesizes that much of the surge in more complex brain activity observed in humans and animals undergoing cardiac arrest is also a result of the brain attempting to reestablish homeostasis, or biological equilibrium, after detecting a lack of oxygen. She further speculates that these survival mechanisms may be involved in other changes in cognition surrounding death. I believe dementia patients’ terminal lucidity may be due to these kinds of last-ditch efforts of the brain to preserve itself as physiological systems fail, Borjigin says.\n\nNYU Langone’s Parnia agrees that the brain's reaction to the loss of oxygen is at least partially responsible for lucid experiences surrounding death. Between 2017 and 2020 Parnia led a study called",
      "AWARE II, in which researchers monitored the brain activity of more than 500 critically ill people in the U.S. and U.K. who were receiving CPR. The patients were exposed to audiovisual stimuli while undergoing CPR to test their memory of events after cardiac arrest. Those who survived were later interviewed about how aware they were during the resuscitation process. According to Parnia, one in five survivors reported lucid experiences that occurred after their heart stopped. The AWARE II team also observed an unexpected spike in brain activity during CPR, he says. “Within 20 seconds of cardiac arrest, the brain flatlines,” Parnia says. Yet “usually within five minutes — but it could be longer — we're seeing a reemergence of a transient period of brain electricity.” He adds that the frequencies of brain activity observed are similar to those associated with conscious experience.\n\nParnia believes the dying brain loses the usual suppression mechanisms that allow us to focus on individual tasks during our day-to-day lives. “When you die, your brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, so it shuts down,” Parnia says. “This shutting down process takes away the brakes..., and suddenly what seems to be happening is: it gives you access to parts of your brain that you normally can’t access..... All your thoughts or your memories or your interactions with everyone else come out.” But he stresses that the experiences of people undergoing cardiac arrest are lucid, not merely hallucinations. “They’re not delusional,” Parnia says of the resuscitated people he studied, and what they’re experiencing is “not dreams or hallucinations.” Although his previous studies focused on resuscitated critically ill people, Parnia believes that terminal lucidity in people who are comatose or have dementia may be the product of a similar process. He is currently participating in a study on the latter phenomenon.\n\nA full explanation for the conscious experiences of dying people remains elusive. But research increasingly paints a picture of death as an incredibly active and complex process — and, perhaps more importantly, “a humanized one,” as Kerr describes it. As for people with dementia, Karlawish says that rather than assuming their consciousness has been irrevocably changed, “we should still pay close attention to their mind because some aspects are still there, though they may be quite damaged.”",
      "Several seconds before cardiac arrest, brain activity was found to disappear. Researchers monitored the brain activities of critically ill people. Patients’ memory of the resuscitation process was explored. Researchers observed an unexpected spike in brain activity during CPR.\n\nIt can be reasonably inferred from the article that the author questions the idea that cognitive decline is a one-way process. What is the most appropriate title for this article? What happens in people’s brains when they undergo cardiac arrest? How does brain science explain life and death? Why dying people often experience a burst of lucidity?",

      "In the past fifty years or so, all kinds of digital technologies have made the lives of the average human being in developed countries a lot easier. At the same time, however, more and more people seem to be concerned that ongoing developments in artificial intelligence (AI) will eventually have disastrous effects on both our minds and bodies. According to the article by Simon Winchester, however, there is no need to be pessimistic. While Winchester may have a point when it comes to tasks for which we do not really need our intellect, I would like to argue that it is naive to think that advances in AI will free our minds and give us more time to contemplate life. Rather, it seems to me that the more we rely on AI, the busier our brains will be.\n\nTo begin with, Winchester is not very clear about what he has in mind when he talks about ‘unnecessary information’. He starts his article with a discussion of the invention of the electronic calculator, but needless to say, widespread use of this device has not led to the removal of arithmetic from school curriculums. Likewise, although GPS is a useful tool, it has driven many people nuts because of its tendency to give wrong directions. So as long as GPS cannot be completely trusted, it will be necessary for us to know how to read a map. Of course I agree that, generally speaking, these inventions make our lives easier, but the point is that we still need basic knowledge about arithmetic and map reading.\n\nRelated to this, I would like to raise some issues concerning recent developments in machine translation. Since the release of ChatGPT, a chatbot that apparently does a better job at writing essays than the average student, I have thought a lot about the possibility that in the future people may not need to learn a foreign language anymore. In fact, this scenario is predicted by the linguist Nicholas Ostler in his 2010 book The Last Lingua Franca: English Until the Return of Babel. According to Ostler, the need for a lingua franca like English will soon disappear because machine translation will do the work for us. Personally, I don’t like the idea of people not learning foreign languages anymore. As a student of the English language, I feel very much enriched by being able to see the world through the lens of a language that is completely different from my own mother tongue, and I think that alone is already reason enough to study a foreign language. Moreover, pure reliance on machine translation would make it impossible for people to judge whether the information that is exchanged really consists of faithful translations of the original words. Therefore, it seems to be important to keep providing and stimulating foreign language education in schools and universities to make sure that there remain enough bilingual or multilingual people in the world. In other words, knowledge of foreign languages should surely not be treated as ‘unnecessary information’.\n\nThere is also a lot of false, misleading, and harmful ‘information’ on the Internet. This is the kind of ‘content’ that in my opinion should be made subject to cleansing. If we don’t want to put restrictions on the possibility for anyone to upload junk or nonsense, it is all the more important that children receive a good education in which they learn to evaluate the large amount of information thrown at them. What we want is large numbers of empty minds surfing the Internet.\n\nAlthough for quite a different reason, I agree with the author that — if we manage to keep our earth livable — we should not be too pessimistic about the future of human intellectual life. As I have tried to show above, the more we rely on AI, the more important it will be for us to keep using our brains. The most important thing, therefore, is that we keep reminding ourselves of the importance of education.",
      "As our reliance on AI increases, will our brains need to work more, or will they need to work less? According to Kayne, scientists need to study global warming and its causes and effects. However, I strongly agree with Kim’s point that extreme weather events such as larger storms and wildfires are likely to become more frequent. White’s study shows/suggests that in her article, Brown says, “humans are responsible for climate change.” While this may be true,"
