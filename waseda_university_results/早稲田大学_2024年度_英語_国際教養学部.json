      "The Ringling Bros, and Barnum & Bailey Circus put on its last show in 2017, after more than 140 years in performance. Many factors led to the demise of the so-called “Greatest Show on Earth” — growing costs, shrinking attention spans, the rise of other forms of entertainment, the effect of local transport legislation on a show that still mostly travels by rail. But one of the loudest arguments in recent memory concerned the show’s animal performers, which came to appear more retrograde than entertaining thanks to an evolving dialogue on animal rights. Following a damning 2011 Mother Jones investigative report and ugly multi-year litigation over elephant care, the circus’s parent company, Feld Entertainment, retired its use of elephants in 2016.\n\nThe showman P.T. Barnum, who died in 1891, takes a lot of heat as the original architect of the circus; he’s widely considered the person who created cruel and callous demand for performing tigers and dancing elephants in the first place. Although there’s truth to this view, a look at Barnum’s career also reveals his surprising involvement with a movement that would, over a century later, cheer the end of his circus. Through his unlikely friendship with the prominent early animal-rights activist Henry Bergh in the late 1800s, Barnum found himself in the thick of the debate over the care and feeding of Victorian animal entertainers. In fact, the animal-rights movement might not have survived to exist in its modern form and breadth if not for the media exposure Barnum lent it in its fragile infancy.\n\nBergh, the previously idle son of a wealthy New York shipping family, founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) in 1866. Motivated by the raucous bullfights and ill-treatment of carriage horses he witnessed as he traveled through Europe, Bergh traded early retirement for a life of activism. He was easily recognizable as he strode around Manhattan looking to intervene in instances of animal abuse. If you were walking a city street in the 1860s and happened to see a tall, lanky gentleman with a giant, drooping mustache, standing in the intersection and hollering at overloaded streetcars to pull over, that was Henry Bergh. One of Bergh’s first public squabbles was with Barnum, whose two American Museums predated his circus ventures by decades, and were the most well-known public attractions in 19th-century New York. Live animals were among the museums’ biggest draws. Barnum featured the nation’s first public aquarium, with sea lions and beluga whales, an unprecedented hippopotamus, assorted birds and beasts, and even the famed mountain man John “Grizzly” Adams frolicking with enormous bears on the top floor. The museums were wildly popular and made Barnum a global celebrity well before he entered the circus business.\n\nIn 1866, after a complaint that Barnum’s staff fed the resident boa constrictor a diet of live rabbits, the newly minted activist Bergh introduced himself to Barnum with the threat of legal action. He called on museum staff personally, hoping to put an end to what he called the “semi-barbarian” practice of feeding snakes live prey before the paying public. If the snakes can’t eat anything else, Bergh urged, in a letter to Barnum, “then let them starve — for, it is contrary to the merciful providence of God that wrong should be committed in order to accomplish a supposed right.” Thanks to his menageries, Barnum had more hands-on experience with exotic animals than many scientists of the era (even if he did go through them at a faster-than-ideal rate), and maintained a solid reputation among zoologists. Seeing no issue with the snake’s diet, Barnum replied to Bergh with the concurring opinion of the Harvard scientist Louis Agassiz, an ASPCA supporter who confirmed that snakes habitually ate live food, and would in fact refuse to eat a dead meal. Barnum insisted that the American Museum would “continue to feed all its animals in accordance with the laws of nature,” and warned Bergh about being too credulous and self-righteous, particularly in public discourse: “This entire story of the trembling, fearful rabbit is a shallow hoax,” Barnum wrote, adding: “In attempting to prevent the abuse of beasts your influence will not be increased by your abuse of men.” Chastened but not dissuaded, Bergh continued his work. Granted enforcement powers under New York’s landmark animal-rights law, Bergh lobbied for the humane treatment of livestock, opposed dogfighting and cockfighting, and advocated for animal care during an 1872 disease outbreak that devastated horses and therefore debilitated a society that needed them for labor, transportation, and commerce.\n\nAlthough Bergh’s remarkable efforts enjoyed the sort of elite political and philanthropic support that nurtured many of the era’s moral movements, he was slow to build broad public backing. In the 19th century, animals were generally regarded as chattel, not as living beings with rights, and what an owner chose to do with his animals was his business. And so as Bergh patrolled the city to root out abuse, most workaday people did not see a noble humanitarian so much as a nosy aristocrat.\n\nBarnum had come out of semi-retirement in the 1870s to build the circus that bore his name. His spring show in 1880 featured the stallion Salamander, who thrilled crowds by jumping through a series of flaming hoops. Despite a then-cordial acquaintance with Barnum, Bergh protested the performance following a report that, after a hoop had slipped, the horse finished its act one night with its mane and tail appearing to be on fire. Through his manager George Bailey, Barnum explained that the flames were chemically created showpieces that posed no danger to man or beast. He even invited Bergh to a repeat",
      "performance to see for himself. Bergh declined, and in his stead sent the superintendent of the ASPCA, a clutch of animal-welfare officers, and 20 New York policemen, who sternly stationed themselves around the ring as 4,000 spectators took their seats. At the close of a bareback-riding routine, Barnum himself entered the arena to roaring applause. He calmed the crowd and announced that although he realized he might end the day under arrest, “Mr. Bergh or I must run this show.” The hoops were set ablaze as the “fire-horse” was led into the ring by his trainer. Barnum grabbed his hat and stuck his hand into the flames. Seventy years old but spirited, the entertainer stepped through the fiery hoop, and in short order he was followed by ten clowns, Salamander and, at Barnum’s invitation, Superintendent Hartfield of the ASPCA. Satisfied on the point of the horse’s safety, Hartfield and a delighted audience called victory for the entertainer. Reflecting on the performance in his autobiography, Barnum refused to crush Bergh or his agenda in that moment: “Although I was forced to resent his ill-advised interference, this episode did not impair my personal regard for Mr. Bergh and my admiration of his noble works.” Perhaps the most notable legacy of Bergh and Barnum is that despite — or perhaps because of — their public sparring, the two men developed a warm and knowing friendship that elevated the profile of animal-rights advocacy at a key historical moment. It is worth remembering that Barnum, for all his flaws, believed that his role was not simply to read the public taste and provide corresponding entertainment, but also to work toward the moral improvement of society. And he was happy to elevate a social cause so long as the tide also carried his own boat. Therefore, had he been alive, Barnum may have even encouraged the elephants’ final bow: For as much as he valued his animal performers and their role in his success, if there were a time when they went so far against public opinion as to be unmarketable, he’d have been behind the final curtain, cooking up the next big thing.",

      "Andreas Cunaeus holds a Leyden jar in his right hand and reaches up to the prime conductor with his left hand. Ewald Jürgen von Kleist, dean of the cathedral in Kammin (now Kammif, Poland), tried to augment the power of a flare of static electricity by increasing the amount of electrified matter from which it sprang: The bigger the prime conductor, the bigger the shock. He ran a wire from the prime conductor into a big glass full of water as a convenient method of effecting the increase in power. No sensible improvement resulted since he insulated the vessel while filling it with electrical effluvia. He next brought a nail stuck in a little bottle filled with alcohol up to the prime conductor; hoping, apparently, to create a portable flare, he held the bottle in his hand. On touching the nail with the other hand, he got a big surprise. He shared it with some children, who were knocked off their feet by the shock. Kleist described his new power to at least five persons, of whom one was a veteran professor of experimental philosophy and another was an able member of the Berlin Academy of Science. None was able to reproduce his results. Not until March 1746, three months after Kleist had announced his striking news, did anyone working from his instructions succeed. He had forgotten to emphasize the counterintuitive step that made a condenser from a nail in a bottle: He did not say that the experimenter must grasp the outside of the bottle and stand on the floor during electrification; he did not say that the bottle’s exterior must be grounded. Without this prescription, the knowledgeable investigator, recognizing the semitransparency of glass, would use a thick bottle and insulate it and/or themselves while trying to fill it from the prime conductor.\n\nWhile Kleist was knocking down children, Pieter van Musschenbroek, professor of physics at the University of Leyden (now Leiden, Netherlands), was trying to draw fire from water. We know how Musschenbroek would have proceeded from Andreas Gordon, professor of physics at the Benedictine convent in Erfurt, a good experimenter who made important improvements in the electro-static machine. Gordon directed that the water-filled vessel rest on an insulating stand while the effluvia run into it via a wire to the prime conductor; otherwise they would leak out the bottom to ground. Here the lawyer Andreas Cunaeus intervened. After visiting Musschenbroek’s laboratory, he tried the experiment on his own. Alone and unaware that the prime conductor must be held by an insulator, he electrified the vessel in the manner most natural, by holding it in his hand. When he drew a spark from the prime conductor with the other, he let the genie out of the bottle.\n\nCunaeus showed Musschenbroek and his assistant how they too could blast themselves with electricity. “I thought I was done for,” the professor then wrote to René-Antoine Réaumur, his correspondent at the Paris Academy, adding precise directions for realizing the “terrible experiment” and advice not to try it. The courageous Jean-Antoine Nollet, informed by Réaumur, bent himself double and knocked out his wind. Others who tried the experiment reported nose bleedings, temporary paralysis, concussions, convulsions, and dizziness. The gallant Johann Heinrich Winkler warned that his wife was unable to walk after he used her to short a Leyden jar. These exaggerations suggest how flagrantly the action of the condenser violated received ideas about electricity. The current theories could not predict the outcome of events. If, by a slight simplification of previous experiments, one could create a blow of unprecedented power, might not a trivial alteration of the Leyden experiment itself transport an unlucky electrician into the next world? Frank admissions that the jar shattered accepted theory appeared on every hand. Musschenbroek, hitherto an authority, now “understood nothing and could explain nothing” about electricity. It appeared that the Leyden experiment was “different in kind” from the classical repertory of experiments in electricity. Perhaps the powers of frictional and communicated electricity differ.",
      "one resourceful commentator supposed — electricity expressed itself in contradictory ways according to the experiment tried. No one was killed or even injured by the Leyden jar. Reports of experiments became soberer. By the end of 1746, consensus had been reached on several facts and errors. Nollet found that the shape of the vessel did not matter but that its substance had to be glass or porcelain. The latter proposition placed an unproductive emphasis on the supposed uniqueness of glass. The former proposition resulted in a piece of glass with metal foil on both sides. Physicists found three ways besides external coating to enlarge their shocks: Daniel Gralath connected jars in parallel into what he called a “battery”; Nollet increased the size of the prime conductor; Gralath and Benjamin Watson found the bottle the fiercer the thinner the glass. A battery of thin-walled jars shorted through the body hit like a club. “The first time I experienced it, it seemed to me as though my arm were struck off at my shoulder, elbow and wrist, and both my legs, at the knees, and behind the ankles,” Watson reported.\n\nScience is a social enterprise. Let a gentleman hold the jar and a lady the prime conductor; both feel the shock when they touch. How many others can be inserted in the train? The Academician Louis-Guillaume Le Monnier tried 140 courtiers, before the king; Nollet shocked 180 soldiers in the same presence. Only persons in the train felt the shock; those in side chains branching from the main line felt nothing. Thus, electricians discovered that the discharge — to use the word they introduced for the climax of the Leyden experiment — goes preferentially along the best conducting circuit between the inside and outside of the jar. Using the same detectors, they learned that the best is not always the shortest. In one demonstration, only those at the extremes of the chain felt the shock. The shock was found to occur only when the train stood on moist ground; apparently the discharge went through the arms and legs of the extreme members and completed its course in the soil.\n\nThe charged jar was also intriguing when innocently insulated. It unaccountably preserved its punch for hours or even days; even when grounded externally, it remained potent provided its top wire was not touched. With its bottom or tail insulated, no explosion, but only a small spark, could be produced by touching the head wire connected with its internal coating. It could then be revivified, or made capable of the Leyden shock, merely by holding it in the hand. This behavior defied explanation or, indeed, any articulation based on the old theories that presupposed certain characteristics of glass.",
      "Here, prescription means a document. Here, knocking down children is used figuratively. Here, violated means abused. Here, authority means government. Here, classical means refined. Here, proposition means assertion. Here, train means exercise. Here, presupposed means assumed.\n\nElectricians found that a Leyden jar has to be made out of glass. Ewald J. von Kleist first invented what became known as the Leyden jar, but initially it was difficult for others to reproduce his experiment. The length of time that a Leyden jar holds a charge can be increased by connecting them in parallel. The phenomena produced by the Leyden jar invalidated the theories of electricity that were current in the mid-18th century.",
      "Elspeth Stuckey’s 1991 book The Violence of Literacy was translated into Japanese by Kyuichi Kikuchi in 1995. In sharing Stuckey’s perspectives on literacy, Kikuchi insists that literacy crucially involves issues of authority and power. Both Stuckey and Kikuchi point out the negative influence of subscribing to the idea of a “single literacy.” They criticize the privileged position of western-style school literacy, which is protected and promoted by powerful institutions. Kikuchi’s work is important, because he shows how literacy serves also as a tool for social control. Literacy, he maintains, monopolizes the construction of social knowledge. This view has gradually spread across Japanese sociolinguistics.\n\nYukitoshi Sunano studies the hegemonic power of the idea of a single literacy and analyzes it as a mechanism of social exclusion. He distinguishes between three categories of literacy comprehension: (1) literacy as a project of the modern age, (2) literacy as an ideological device, and (3) literacy as a mechanism of exclusion. Consider these three perspectives in more detail: To start, literacy is a product of the modern age that has laid the foundation for the construction of the “citizen.” Hence, literacy is linked to concepts of enlightenment such as “freedom,” “citizenship,” and “democracy”; that is, key ideas used to break free from the limits of feudal society. In order to accomplish discourse in the public sphere under democratic values, acquiring literacy became seen as a precondition for the existence of modern societies. By looking at literacy through such “modernist lenses,” western-style schooling comes to be seen as the central institution responsible for spreading literacy.\n\nThe idea of literacy as an ideological device presents literacy as a product of the modern age where people are integrated into the nation in order to control them. Sunano identifies critical literacy as an important concept in order to overcome the limits of the idea of standard literacy.\n\nLast, literacy as a mechanism of exclusion highlights the existence of a demarcation line by literacy. When literacy is connected to a writing system too complicated for ordinary people to learn, then the establishment can monopolize it. In other words, literacy becomes a tool to control illiterate people. This is how literacy functioned in feudal societies. Literacy as a product of the modern age appears to disrupt this mechanism of excluding people. However, contrary to what most people think, the exclusivity characteristic of literacy remains intact in modern societies. The idea of “single literacy,” owned and controlled by the establishment, is part and parcel of such mechanisms of exclusion.\n\nFrom these three points of view, the stigma of being illiterate emerges as the result of social rejection through the exclusionary function of literacy. It can also be connected to the global tendency of stigmatizing the illiterate, an idea that UNESCO and other institutions inadvertently reproduce through some of their campaigns. In spite of their philanthropic efforts, negative connotations are inherent in slogans such as “eradication of illiteracy.” The excluding function of literacy is not resolved in this way. It continues to do its work. Next, we will discuss concrete examples demonstrating how literacy results in exclusion in Japanese contexts.\n\nThe contemporary Japanese writing system is beyond doubt very difficult. The number of “general-use kanji” is presently limited to 2,136 characters. However, many more kanji are used in daily life. Most kanji have at least two pronunciations, further complicating the Japanese script. Literacy in Japanese is widely associated with the ability to read, write, and remember an enormous number of kanji. The term monmo literally means “sentence-blindness”; thus, we can see a deep tie between illiteracy and disability already in the term monmo. This notwithstanding, literacy studies in Japan have avoided discussing the literacy of people with disabilities. It is no exaggeration to say that people with disabilities have been excluded from literacy studies.\n\nIn order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of exclusion through literacy and disabilities, Tomoyuki Sumi flatly rejects the popular myth that the literacy rate of Japan stands at 99%. The main pillar of this myth is a survey conducted after WWII under the US occupation. Results of an extensive literacy survey conducted in 1948 were published by a Research Committee for Literacy as a report titled Survey on the Literacy of the Japanese People. It consisted of 90 questions that included hiragana, katakana, and kanji, both used independently and intermixed. The survey was conducted among 21,008 Japanese, who had been invited to participate in this survey by postcards using kanji and kana mixed orthography, between the ages of 15 and 64 years across 270 municipalities. The results showed that 4.4% had perfect scores, while 1.7% had scored zero. These 1.7% serve as the basis to claim that 99% of the Japanese population is literate, which is surprising given that the report itself states that “the literate criteria is only fulfilled by a perfect score.” If this procedure had been applied, the literacy rate according to this survey would have been 4.4%, an equally inappropriate result. What matters for our discussion here is simply that the “total literacy myth” was built upon a problematic survey methodology (written invitations) and a one-sided interpretation of the results (everyone who did not score zero is literate).\n\nAt the time the survey was conducted, there was an intense debate on the Japanese language and its",
      "Some placed a high value on the phonographic writing system and argued to abolish kanji altogether, while others advocated the continued use of kanji. Needless to say, those in support of maintaining kanji used the results of the literacy survey to advance their cause. They created the 99% literacy myth, according to Hitoshi Yamashita. This myth then spread around the world. Consider a statement cited by the International Bureau of Education and UNESCO two decades after the survey: “The problem of illiteracy has been solved completely. Modern Japanese is usually transcribed in Japanese syllabaries (48 phonetic letters) and kanji (1,850 words, ideographs for the most part). A person is considered illiterate if he is unable to read and write these words and letters at all.” This was the official statement made at an international conference on public education by the Japanese Ministry of Education.\n\nHowever, different ideological positions on language led to different interpretations of the survey results. It is for this reason that Sumi returns to a discussion of the 1948 survey in order to examine the effects of this myth on parts of Japanese society. Sumi stresses that this official position cannot be tenable already for the fact that this number obviously excludes people with mental or physical disabilities. In 1948, people with disabilities were not enrolled in the education system; many remained illiterate for their entire lives as a result. Their illiteracy was hidden to help sustain the literacy myth, allowing the Japanese government to boast about the efficiency of its educational system. In short, then: the number of illiterate Japanese is higher than claimed, some individuals are illiterate as a result of discrimination, and discrimination in Japanese society is not sufficiently reflected upon.",
      "Here, this notwithstanding means consequently. Here, tenable means justified. Choose the FOUR statements that do NOT AGREE with what the passage says. An important survey on Japanese literacy rates was undertaken during the US occupation. Official statements made by the Japanese government have spread false information about Japanese literacy rates around the world. People with mental and physical disabilities are usually excluded from statistical surveys conducted by international organizations. The concept of literacy can function as a way to control people. The high literacy rate of Japan is considered to be declining because of a new research methodology aligned to the global standard. There was a time when some people proposed discontinuing the use of kanji in the Japanese writing system. UNESCO and other institutions are viewed to have liberated the oppressed in modern societies by eradicating illiteracy. Western-style schooling was rejected in Japan because it was felt that the difference in writing systems made it inappropriate.\n\nWrite a paragraph in ENGLISH giving your opinion on the statement below, with appropriate reasons to support your position.

      "Tacos are an internationally popular hand-sized food item of Mexican origin combining seasoned meat, vegetables, and other fillings and served inside a folded or rolled corn or flour tortilla. Maize has been domesticated in Mexico for at least 9,000 years, and one of the first uses of ground maize was very likely the tortilla, a flatbread made of maize, ground lime, and water. The name taco may come from the Spanish word for dowel, as in a plug to fill a hungry stomach, or, perhaps likelier, from the Nahuatl word tlacoyo, the name of a related foodstuff. The taco is made of that bread base, but its ingredients thereafter can be various. In Mexican cuisine, tacos can contain beef, chicken, pork, fish, and shellfish as well as vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, radishes, chiles, and tomatoes. Tacos can also be vegetarian, filled with retried beans, avocado, potatoes, and cheese.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico, the meats eaten in tacos were likely reptiles such as snakes and iguanas, as well as native mammals and birds such as armadillos and turkeys; insects such as grasshoppers were (and are) eaten in tacos as well. With the arrival of Eurasian livestock, tacos acquired a yet more diverse protein base. The Spanish also introduced cheese, lettuce and cabbage, and other foodstuffs, adding to foods of South American origin such as tomatoes, potatoes, and chiles. It is said that if the typical taco were to visit the origins of each of its ingredients, it would have to travel some 64,000 miles.\n\nThe taco remains a staple of Mexican cuisine, sold in fine restaurants and street stalls alike. It has also enjoyed international success, embraced everywhere it has landed. In the United States, where “taco Tuesday” has become common nationwide, it is estimated that there are some 50,000 Mexican restaurants, nearly all of them offering tacos. Mexican restaurants abound in major cities in Europe, Oceania, and East Asia, and local variations have been recorded. In South Korea, for example, diners enjoy tacos with the customary ingredients and also with the addition of kimchi."
