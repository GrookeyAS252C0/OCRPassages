      "In daily life, many people are unaware of the thousands of species that inhabit the body. In fact, being unaware of them is the first good sign of a healthy microbiome. This is because many of the microbes in the body are symbiotic, meaning that when working correctly, their presence allows both the human body and community of microorganisms to benefit.\n\nBecause microorganisms are invisible to the eye, we have limited control over the types of microbes that enter our bodies. A small number of those in the microbiome, known as pathogens, will be disease-causing. The body can remain healthy, even in the presence of pathogens, but there is a fine balance to be struck. If too many pathogens are introduced to the body, or an increased use of antibiotics lowers the number of helpful bacteria too much, the healthy microbiome is disturbed. This puts the body at a higher risk of disease.\n\nThe microbiome has so many essential roles that it is often referred to as a ‘supporting organ.’ Two of its main functions are helping to keep the digestive system under control and assisting the immune system.\n\nThe mechanical digestion that human cells are responsible for can only do so much when it comes to completely breaking down our food. For many foods, we rely on gut bacteria. One example is polysaccharides — complex sugars that are found in plants. In the gut, bacteria produce the enzymes needed to digest polysaccharides. By breaking down these foods, the microbiome is responsible for turning food into its easily absorbed nutrients. These enzymes provide us with B vitamins, Vitamin K and short chain fatty acids. Without the microbiome to carry out this function, the nutritional value of food would be lowered.\n\nWhen new organisms are introduced into the gut, and other regions of the body, the microbiome plays a key part in establishing which are safe and which attack. This aspect of the immune system is essential as, without it, the aforementioned beneficial gut bacteria would be perceived as a threat and attacked by the body.\n\nMicrobes don’t just fight dangerous cells after they enter the body. A layer of them, called biofilm, serves as a protective shield on our skin against harmful bacteria and fungi. Similarly, in the gut, specific bacteria called Bifidobacteria prevent toxins from entering the bloodstream. Keeping toxins in the gut means they can soon be passed out of the body. However, if they were to travel through the intestinal wall and into the blood, toxins can wreak havoc as they spread fast in the bloodstream.\n\nMicrobiome activity in the gut also has the power to impact the mind, thanks to a nerve called the vagus nerve and the gut-brain axis. As microorganisms in the gut interact with the central nervous system, studies have shown that the brain’s chemistry can be altered, impacting a person’s memory. Additionally, gut bacteria can even make you happier, as it is responsible for producing 95 per cent of the body’s serotonin. This hormone is key in determining people’s mental well-being as it stabilizes mood.\n\nA person’s microbiome is unique to them. At the beginning of life, its original makeup is determined by that of their mother. As a baby is born, its body is exposed to the microorganisms that exist in the mother’s birth canal. Further significant additions to the microbiome are provided in milk during breastfeeding. These environmental impacts continue to occur throughout life. Microbiomes change based on events including the food being eaten, medication taken, disease, exercise and age.\n\nThe more your microbiome changes, the healthier you are, according to research published in February 2021. Scientists discovered that people whose microbiome remained the same for long periods of their lives tend to die earlier than those whose microbiome varied over time. Generally, in the healthiest individual studied, the microorganisms that were most prevalent during early adulthood became a smaller percentage of the gut microbiome over the following years. This enabled new species to grow in numbers in the body.\n\nIt isn’t yet known whether people aged better as a result of the changed microbiome, or if it was the microbiome that adapted to the ageing body. However, the guts with the more transformed microbiome appeared to be better at fighting chronic illness.\n\nTransforming your gut microbiome is relatively easy to do. By drastically altering your diet, the levels of your body’s bacteria species can change significantly in just four days. This trait is thought to have been beneficial to hunter gatherers, who could have had contrasting meals from day to day depending on available resources. With different gut bacteria being able to dominate the microbiome, more nutrients could be extracted from each varied food source.",

An executive at a company has to be able to balance the reality of what the company needs to be now with what it needs to be in ten years from now, for these are often at odds with one another.

      "People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains are doubly handicapped: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across studies, the authors found that participants scoring low on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the bottom 12%, they estimated themselves to be in the top 38%. Several analyses linked this to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of the participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.\n\nHuman infants use rhythmic cues present in speech to extract language regularities, and it has been suggested that this capacity is anchored in more general mechanisms that are shared across mammals. This study explores the extent to which rats can generalize rhythmic cues that have been extracted from training samples to new sentences and how this discrimination process is affected by the cognitive burden when multiple speakers are introduced. Conditions show rats’ abilities to use rhythmic cues present in speech, allowing them to discriminate between sentences not previously heard. But this discrimination is not possible when sentences are played backward. Conditions show that language discrimination by rats is also taxed by the process of detecting regularities among different speakers. Implications for speech perception by humans are discussed.\n\nThe researchers examine the role of alcohol consumption on self-perceived attractiveness. Study 1, carried out in a barroom, showed that the more alcoholic drinks customers consumed, the more attractive they thought they were. In Study 2, non-student participants in a fake taste-test study were given either an alcoholic beverage or a non-alcoholic beverage, with half of each group believing they had consumed alcohol and half believing they had not (balanced placebo design). After consuming beverages, they delivered a speech and rated how attractive, bright, original, and funny they thought they were. The speeches were videotaped and rated by independent judges. Results showed that participants who thought they had consumed alcohol gave themselves more positive self-evaluations. However, ratings from independent judges showed that this boost in self-evaluation was unrelated to actual performance."
