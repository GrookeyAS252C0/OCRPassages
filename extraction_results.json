At the time,\nI had just started writing for the magazine New York, and my editor did not have the Liberian civil\nwar high on his list of most urgent topics. But I was lucky — my editor was understanding enough to\nlet me write about the war for The New York Times Magazine, my first legitimate foreign assignment.\n\nEverything about the Liberian civil war was unusual and terrible and fascinating. I was especially\ntaken, though, by the Liberian press — a group of reporters, editors, and photographers who were\naggressive, clever, and determined. There was not cnough food in Monrovia, no clean water, barely\nany electricity, yet the press somehow found enough ink and paper to produce some astonishing\njournalism.\n\nThe strange thing is that, after all this time, it is an advertisement from these Liberian papers that I\nremember most clearly. It was an ad that helped me understand — in a real lightning strike of\nunderstanding — the best way to approach magazine writing and editing, which I was just then\nlearning.\n\nThe ad was for a local butcher shop and read “All Paris of the Cow.” = @) |. “All Parts of the\nCow” has stayed with me for almost thirty years because it became the way I explain the difference\nbetween newspaper writing and magazine writing.\n\nLike many magazine people, I started in newspapers, and I loved the work: the adrenaline, the\nurgency, the high-pressure collaboration. When I was a novice reporter on the night police beat at The\nWashington Post, I once left the newsroom at four a.m., wandered to the basement pressroom, and\ngrabbed an actually hot-off-the-presses copy of the morning’s paper, one with my signed article on the\nfront page. At the bottom, but never mind. It still felt great.\n\n(2) _], What I’m about to say is not meant to be a criticism of newspapers or newspaper people.\nObviously, newspapers, especially the big national papers, are stuffed with creative, brave, and talented\npeople who are also, by the way, helping to save our democracy, which is no small thing.\n\nThe problem T had was twofold: First was the amount of clichés. On the police desk, we joked that\nthe city had only two types of streets: “quiet, tree-lined streets” or “trash-scattered, drug-plagued\nstreets.” Ionce{ 4 ), but he didn’t have time to get the joke.\n\nCliché is everywhere, especially in writing. Clichés are one of the prices we pay in journalism for\nspeed, but alertness and a brisk pre-edit scrub will eliminate most of them. | ‘3) |.\n\nThe second problem: In newspaper editing it is common to remove wild feeling, weird detail,\nirregular observation, and the disturbing dynamics of writers interacting with their subjects and the\nworld. A smart New Yorker editor, the late John Bennet, once told me that the real bias in journalism\nis toward consistency, and though there are other biases — of course — this seemed undoubtedly true.\nThis unexamined bias causes us to think that stories have beginnings, middles and endings, that all\nquestions must be answered, and that everything that happens in the universe happens for a reason.\n\nMagazine people, generally speaking, have a different understanding: Not every story has an ending;\nnot every story even has a beginning. Not everything has to make sense. Not everything is knowable.\nAnd most importantly, something that always and forever adds confusion and complexity to story\nmaking: The presence of writers (and their experiences, beliefs, personalities, histories, and\ndispositions) inevitably changes the reality of whatever the writers are observing and describing.\nL(@ J. “Put it in, put it all in,” is an efficient way to describe this style of editing. Another way to\ndescribe it: “All parts of the cow.”\n\nLast year, when I asked Jennifer Senior, who had just joined the staff of The Atlantic, if she had\nanything original to say about the twentieth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (originality\ntraditionally being scarce on anniversaries of world-historical events), she thought for a minute and\nthen said, “Maybe, but it’s complicated.” The story she sketched for me then was something more\nthan complicated. It was exquisitely personal, and it featured — of all people — a 9/11 truther. “A\ngood man,” Jen said, something never previously said by sane people about 9/11 truthers. We talked\nand talked and talked. And then I thought, “All parts of the cow,” and I said, “Let’s try it.” Just put\nit all in. And then Jen and her editor, Scott Stossel, made something magical happen, and we\npublished her story and it won the National Magazine Award for Feature Writing and the Pulitzer\nPrize for Feature Writing. | (5) |. Jen, Scott, and I realized, late in the process, that the story didn’t\neven have anything resembling a nut graf — a term, borrowed from newspapering, for the paragraph\nthat explains why you, the reader, should continue reading this story.

In their experiment, 28\npeople ,,.learned to distinguish the duration of ,,,two visual or two auditory stimuli. For example,\nthe study participants looked at two shapes or heard two distinct tones. One item or sound from\neach pair ..,presented for 200 milliseconds, and the other lasted for 400 milliseconds.\n\n@) Next, people saw a new cue — another tone or shape — and had to estimate ,,how the\npresentation felt shorter or longer, using the previous pair for reference. But there was an added\ntwist. These new sounds and shapes were ,,.matched with a particular moment in the rhythm of\nsomeone’s heart rate: when the heart either contracted (the systole) or relaxed (the diastole)\n(during the heartbeat. During systole, the volunteers ,,,perceived time duration to be shorter than\nit actually was. During diastole, ,,,the exact opposite was true.\n\n#4) According to Arslanova and her colleagues, the phenomenon may be ,,,explained by the fact that\npressure sensors in blood vessel walls send signals to the brain and affect ,,,its capacity to process\nincoming information. ,,,This increase in sensory impressions could make time feel longer. A similar\nfinding was published in March 2023 by a group of researchers at Cornell University, who ,,,focused\non differences in time perception between single heartbeats. When that span is longer, they\ndiscovered, time feels slower. ,,.When there is more time between two beats, time seems to move\nfaster.\n\n5) Researchers from both groups caution that those experiences are influenced by many factors,\nincluding our emotion and attention. They also happen .,,at a totally different scale. As Adam K.\nAnderson, one of the authors of the March study, explains, however, the new work illuminates how\nthe heart influences the experience of time as it unfolds. He confirms that how the body and brain\nrelate is ,..of growing interest in neuroscience. “People are ,,,comfortable with the idea that the\nbrain can influence what the heart does,” he says. But reversing that relationship is novel and really\nfascinating. “Your brain,” he adds, “might be listening to patterns in your heart to shape somcthing\ni: Similarly fundamental as the passage of time.”\n7E neuroscientist PRBS cue LDAP ORRELIBUSRRKO FAD) systole -(\\Ba4#a HA)\n\ndiastole -LRRSHR (LA) UH) — blood vessel walls MM 7f#:\n(B) POR MERA, PRM), 1), OAR L.\n\nMy mother had raised me vegetarian, and though I harbored no real desire to eat meat, sometimes,\nin summer, I would take a large piece of watermelon to a remote corner of our yard and pretend it was\na fresh dead animal.

      "2024 Rik RRA flea\nLA FORMERA, (A~DOMVICEZ £-\n\nMy love for walking started in childhood, out of necessity. I didn’t want to stay at home. I found\nevery reason to stay away from home and was usually out — at some friend’s house or at a street party\nwhere no kids should be — until it was too late to get public transportation. So I walked.\n\nThe streets of Kingston, Jamaica, in the 1980s were often terrifying, but I 726 friends with\nstrangers. The beggar, the vendor, the poor laborer — those were experienced wanderers, and they\nbecame my nighttime instructors; they knew the streets and delivered lessons on how to explore and\nenjoy them. The streets had their own safety: Unlike at home, there I could be myself without fear.\nWalking became so regular and familiar that ,,,the way home became home.\n\nThe streets had their rules, and I loved the challenge of trying to master them. I learned how to be\nalert to surrounding dangers and nearby delights, and myself on recognizing significant details\nthat my peers missed. Kingston was a map of complex, and often bizarre, cultural and political and\nsocial activity, and I appointed myself its nighttime mapmaker.\n\nI left Jamaica in 1996 to attend college in New Orleans, a city I’d heard called “the northernmost\nCaribbean city.” I wanted to discover — on foot, of course — what was Caribbean and what was\nAmerican about it.\n\nOn my first day in the city, I went walking for a few hours to get a feel for the place and to buy\nsupplies to transform my dormitory room into a welcoming space. When some university staff members\nfound out what I’d been up to, they | 78 | me to restrict my walking to the places recommended as safe\nto tourists and the parents of new students. They mentioned statistics about New Orleans’s crime rate.\nBut Kingston’s crime rate far exceeded those numbers, and I decided to ignore these well-meant\ncautions. A city was waiting to be discovered, and I wouldn’t let inconvenient facts get in the way.\nThese American criminals are nothing compared to Kingston’s, ] thought. They’re no real threat to me.\n\nWhat no one ,, who would be considered a threat.\n\nWithin days I noticed that many people on the street seemed afraid of me: Some gave me a glance as\nthey approached, and then crossed the street; others, ahead, would glance behind, notice my presence,\nand then speed up; older white women clutched their bags; young white men nervously greeted me, as if\nexchanging a salutation for their safety: “What’s up, bro?” On one occasion, less than a month after my\narrival, I tried to help a man whose wheelchair was stuck in the middle of a street; he threatened to\nshoot me in the face, then asked a white person for help.\n\nI wasn’t prepared for any of this. I had come from a majority-black country in which no one was wary\nof me because of my skin color. Now I wasn’t sure who was afraid of me. I was especially unprepared\nfor the cops. They regularly stopped and |_7@9_ me, asking questions that took my guilt for granted.\nI'd never received what many of my African American friends call “The Talk”: No parents had told me\nhow to behave when I was stopped by the police, how to be as polite and cooperative as possible, no\nmatter what they said or did to me.\n\nMy survival tactics began. In this city of energetic streets, walking became a complex and often\noppressive negotiation. I would see a white woman walking toward me at night and cross the street to\nreassure her that she was safe. I would forget something at home but not immediately turn around if\nsomeone was behind me, because I discovered that a sudden turn could cause alarm. New Orleans\nsuddenly felt more dangerous than Jamaica. Despite my best efforts, the streets never felt comfortably\nsafe. Even a simple salutation was suspect.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina hit the area, my aunt persuaded me to come to stay in New York City. I\nexplored the city with friends, and then with a woman I’d begun dating. She walked around endlessly\nwith me, taking in New York City’s many pleasures. My impressions of the city took shape during my\nwalks with her. But it wasn’t long before reality reminded me I wasn’t |__|, especially when I walked\nalone.\n\nOne night in the East Village, I was running to dinner when a white man in front of me turned and\nsuddenly punched me in the chest. I assumed he was drunk or had mistaken me for an old enemy, but\nfound out soon enough that he’d merely assumed I was a criminal because of my race. When he\ndiscovered I wasn’t what he [_7&0_], he went on to tell me that his assault was my own fault for running\nup behind him. ,,] returned to the old rules I’d set for myself in New Orleans.\n\nI’m still trying to arrive in a city that isn’t quite mine. One definition of home is that it’s somewhere\nwe can most be ourselves. And when are we more ourselves but when walking, that natural state in\nwhich we repeat one of the first actions we learned? A foot leaves, a foot lands, and our longing gives it\nmomentum from rest to rest. We long to look, to think, to talk, to get away. But more than anything\nelse, we long to be free. We want the freedom and pleasure of walking without fear — without others’\nfear — wherever we choose. I’ve lived in New York City for almost a decade and have not\nwalking its fascinating streets. And I still long to find the comfort that I found as a kid on the streets of\nKingston.\n\ni Kingston 4V7AhY(AUVTHOBRYY VT AOR) beggar WOWVETSZA\n\nvendor #91950) New Orleans =2-4-VYAPAUAGRAVAYTTMORM)\n\n© Obunsha Co.,Ltd.

One item or sound from\neach pair ..,presented for 200 milliseconds, and the other lasted for 400 milliseconds.\n\n@) Next, people saw a new cue — another tone or shape — and had to estimate ,,how the\npresentation felt shorter or longer, using the previous pair for reference. But there was an added\ntwist. These new sounds and shapes were ,,.matched with a particular moment in the rhythm of\nsomeone’s heart rate: when the heart either contracted (the systole) or relaxed (the diastole)\n(during the heartbeat. During systole, the volunteers ,,,perceived time duration to be shorter than\nit actually was. During diastole, ,,,the exact opposite was true.\n\n#4) According to Arslanova and her colleagues, the phenomenon may be ,,,explained by the fact that\npressure sensors in blood vessel walls send signals to the brain and affect ,,,its capacity to process\nincoming information. ,,,This increase in sensory impressions could make time feel longer. A similar\nfinding was published in March 2023 by a group of researchers at Cornell University, who ,,,focused\non differences in time perception between single heartbeats. When that span is longer, they\ndiscovered, time feels slower. ,,.When there is more time between two beats, time seems to move\nfaster.\n\n5) Researchers from both groups caution that those experiences are influenced by many factors,\nincluding our emotion and attention. They also happen .,,at a totally different scale. As Adam K.\nAnderson, one of the authors of the March study, explains, however, the new work illuminates how\nthe heart influences the experience of time as it unfolds. He confirms that how the body and brain\nrelate is ,..of growing interest in neuroscience. “People are ,,,comfortable with the idea that the\nbrain can influence what the heart does,” he says. But reversing that relationship is novel and really\nfascinating. “Your brain,” he adds, “might be listening to patterns in your heart to shape somcthing\ni: Similarly fundamental as the passage of time.”\n7E neuroscientist PRBS cue LDAP ORRELIBUSRRKO FAD) systole -(\\Ba4#a HA)\n\ndiastole -LRRSHR (LA) UH) — blood vessel walls MM 7f#:\n(B) POR MERA, PRM), 1), OAR L.\n\nMy mother had raised me vegetarian, and though I harbored no real desire to eat meat, sometimes,\nin summer, I would take a large piece of watermelon to a remote corner of our yard and pretend it was\na fresh dead animal.

      "2024 Rik RRA flea\nLA FORMERA, (A~DOMVICEZ £-\n\nMy love for walking started in childhood, out of necessity. I didn’t want to stay at home. I found\nevery reason to stay away from home and was usually out — at some friend’s house or at a street party\nwhere no kids should be — until it was too late to get public transportation. So I walked.\n\nThe streets of Kingston, Jamaica, in the 1980s were often terrifying, but I 726 friends with\nstrangers. The beggar, the vendor, the poor laborer — those were experienced wanderers, and they\nbecame my nighttime instructors; they knew the streets and delivered lessons on how to explore and\nenjoy them. The streets had their own safety: Unlike at home, there I could be myself without fear.\nWalking became so regular and familiar that ,,,the way home became home.\n\nThe streets had their rules, and I loved the challenge of trying to master them. I learned how to be\nalert to surrounding dangers and nearby delights, and myself on recognizing significant details\nthat my peers missed. Kingston was a map of complex, and often bizarre, cultural and political and\nsocial activity, and I appointed myself its nighttime mapmaker.\n\nI left Jamaica in 1996 to attend college in New Orleans, a city I’d heard called “the northernmost\nCaribbean city.” I wanted to discover — on foot, of course — what was Caribbean and what was\nAmerican about it.\n\nOn my first day in the city, I went walking for a few hours to get a feel for the place and to buy\nsupplies to transform my dormitory room into a welcoming space. When some university staff members\nfound out what I’d been up to, they | 78 | me to restrict my walking to the places recommended as safe\nto tourists and the parents of new students. They mentioned statistics about New Orleans’s crime rate.\nBut Kingston’s crime rate far exceeded those numbers, and I decided to ignore these well-meant\ncautions. A city was waiting to be discovered, and I wouldn’t let inconvenient facts get in the way.\nThese American criminals are nothing compared to Kingston’s, ] thought. They’re no real threat to me.\n\nWhat no one ,, who would be considered a threat.\n\nWithin days I noticed that many people on the street seemed afraid of me: Some gave me a glance as\nthey approached, and then crossed the street; others, ahead, would glance behind, notice my presence,\nand then speed up; older white women clutched their bags; young white men nervously greeted me, as if\nexchanging a salutation for their safety: “What’s up, bro?” On one occasion, less than a month after my\narrival, I tried to help a man whose wheelchair was stuck in the middle of a street; he threatened to\nshoot me in the face, then asked a white person for help.\n\nI wasn’t prepared for any of this. I had come from a majority-black country in which no one was wary\nof me because of my skin color. Now I wasn’t sure who was afraid of me. I was especially unprepared\nfor the cops. They regularly stopped and |_7@9_ me, asking questions that took my guilt for granted.\nI'd never received what many of my African American friends call “The Talk”: No parents had told me\nhow to behave when I was stopped by the police, how to be as polite and cooperative as possible, no\nmatter what they said or did to me.\n\nMy survival tactics began. In this city of energetic streets, walking became a complex and often\noppressive negotiation. I would see a white woman walking toward me at night and cross the street to\nreassure her that she was safe. I would forget something at home but not immediately turn around if\nsomeone was behind me, because I discovered that a sudden turn could cause alarm. New Orleans\nsuddenly felt more dangerous than Jamaica. Despite my best efforts, the streets never felt comfortably\nsafe. Even a simple salutation was suspect.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina hit the area, my aunt persuaded me to come to stay in New York City. I\nexplored the city with friends, and then with a woman I’d begun dating. She walked around endlessly\nwith me, taking in New York City’s many pleasures. My impressions of the city took shape during my\nwalks with her. But it wasn’t long before reality reminded me I wasn’t |__|, especially when I walked\nalone.\n\nOne night in the East Village, I was running to dinner when a white man in front of me turned and\nsuddenly punched me in the chest. I assumed he was drunk or had mistaken me for an old enemy, but\nfound out soon enough that he’d merely assumed I was a criminal because of my race. When he\ndiscovered I wasn’t what he [_7&0_], he went on to tell me that his assault was my own fault for running\nup behind him. ,,] returned to the old rules I’d set for myself in New Orleans.\n\nI’m still trying to arrive in a city that isn’t quite mine. One definition of home is that it’s somewhere\nwe can most be ourselves. And when are we more ourselves but when walking, that natural state in\nwhich we repeat one of the first actions we learned? A foot leaves, a foot lands, and our longing gives it\nmomentum from rest to rest. We long to look, to think, to talk, to get away. But more than anything\nelse, we long to be free. We want the freedom and pleasure of walking without fear — without others’\nfear — wherever we choose. I’ve lived in New York City for almost a decade and have not\nwalking its fascinating streets. And I still long to find the comfort that I found as a kid on the streets of\nKingston.\n\ni Kingston 4V7AhY(AUVTHOBRYY VT AOR) beggar WOWVETSZA\n\nvendor #91950) New Orleans =2-4-VYAPAUAGRAVAYTTMORM)\n\n© Obunsha Co.,Ltd.
